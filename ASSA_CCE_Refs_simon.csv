The aim is to study the suitability of three different active teaching-learning strategies: problem-based learning (PBL), project-oriented learning (POL), and a cross-disciplinary workshop. Another goal is to promote the integration of education for sustainable development (ESD) and measure the level of acquisition of several competencies of sustainability and the change in consumption habits of future teachers after implementing those pedagogical approaches. Initial and final ecological footprint (EF) as well as a rubric to measure the level of acquisition of competencies of sustainability were used as data collection instruments. The conclusions related to the research objectives show that when sustainability is implemented in the curriculum through active teaching-learning strategies, future teachers acquire competencies of sustainability. They also reveal that said strategies contribute to a change in consumption habits as a reduction in the EF is observed. There exists a relation between EF reduction and high levels of acquisition of competency in sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.",Education for sustainable development; Individual ecological footprint; Initial teacher training; Sustainable competencies; Sustainable consumption patterns; Transformative learning,ecological footprint; educational attainment; higher education; learning; sustainable development; teacher training; university sector; Spain,,,,,"EDU 2015-65574-R

For this purpose, they were given a questionnaire to assess the link between certain personal and educational characteristics relating to the students in the sample (n = 274) and three components of an environmental competence (EC) model: environmental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. The results indicate that variables like gender, the students' habitual place of residence, the type of leisure activities they undertook, and some educational factors had a significant impact on the acquisition of the said competencies. In light of these outcomes, the paper reflects on the possible role that non-university contexts might play in environmental education for pre-service teachers. © 2019 by the authors.",Education for sustainable development; Environmental competencies; Environmental education; Influential variables; Pre-service teacher training,demography; education; environmental education; sustainable development; teacher training; university sector; Spain,,,,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: MTM2017-86061-C2-1-P

Of these, 49 sources met the criteria of focusing on assessment of climate change education interventions. Analysis of these sources examined the intervention purpose, assessment methodology, and identified strategies that might result in effective interventions. Two themes were identified that are common to most environmental education: (1) focusing on personally relevant and meaningful information and (2) using active and engaging teaching methods. Four themes specific to issues such as climate change were also generated: (1) engaging in deliberative discussions, (2) interacting with scientists, (3) addressing misconceptions, and (4) implementing school or community projects.

Prior research shows that climate education may build concern among adolescents, but other factors such as peer pressure may also be important. We investigated the relationships between CCC, acceptance of anthropogenic global warming (AGW), perceived level of acceptance among friends and family, and frequency of discussion of the issue among 426 middle school students in North Carolina, USA, and developed a novel instrument to measure each of these constructs. Acceptance of AGW had the strongest association with CCC. Frequency of discussion with friends and family was the second strongest predictor. Perceived level of acceptance among family and friends was the third strongest predictor. Model selection results suggest family had more influence than friends in this study. Girls perceived climate change as a higher risk than boys. In addition to building acceptance of AGW, leveraging discussions with peers and especially family may help build concern for climate change among future generations. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Climate change; climate change concern; climate communication; climate conversations; climate education; climate literacy,,,,,,"North Carolina Sea Grant, North Carolina State University, NCSG: 2012-R/12-HCE-5","This work was supported by North Carolina Sea Grant [Project number 2012-R/12-HCE-5].

International initiatives to promote education for sustainable development (ESD) have been hampered by a lack of clarity on how to implement this form of education. To address this concern, a Rounder Sense of Purpose (RSP) began as a three-year EU-funded project that set out to develop a practical accreditation model for educators working on ESD. Expert and user opinion was sought through several rounds of structured consultation with over 500 people, chiefly using a Delphi approach, to develop and validate the model. The resulting framework comprises 12 competences, each with three learning outcomes and several underpinning components. This is supported by a range of activities largely reflecting a constructivist pedagogy. A range of assessment techniques have also been piloted within the project although this remains an area for further enquiry. Ultimately, it was decided not to design a single qualification template because defining the award to such a level of detail would make it more difficult to apply across multiple jurisdictions. Partners also felt that such an approach would atomize learning in a way that runs counter to the holistic principles of sustainability. RSP provided a rich learning experience for those involved and has already demonstrated its potential to extend its impact well beyond the original participants. © 2019 by the authors.",Competence framework; Competences; ESD; Teacher education,economic growth; education; education policy; European Union; holistic approach; learning; sustainability; sustainable development; teaching; training,,,,,,,,,"Vare, P.; School of Education, Francis Close Hall, United Kingdom; email: pvare@glos.ac.uk",,,MDPI AG,,,,,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064068546

Recently, there have also been several studies describing students’ and teachers’ alternative conceptions about GCC. Therefore, designing learning environments at the college level that focus on accurate conceptions of GCC has become important in order for pre-service teachers to correct their alternative conceptions. There are, however, a limited number of studies that aim to both increase pre-service teachers’ knowledge about these issues and explore their perceptions of teaching this subject. Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of inquiry-based activities on pre-service teachers’ knowledge about GCC and their perceptions of teaching this subject. Sample The participants were 102 pre-service middle school mathematics and science teachers who were enrolled in an environmental education course. Design and methods A one group pre-test–post-test design was employed to identify changes after pre-service teachers engaged in a learning unit on GCC. The inquiry-based GCC unit was implemented during the spring semester at a public university in northeastern Turkey. The unit was implemented over seven sessions. Data were collected through two questionnaires: the ‘GCC content questionnaire’ and the ‘perceptions of teaching GCC questionnaire’. Each questionnaire was administered both before and after implementation of the unit. Content questionnaire responses were analyzed using a paired-samples t-test. Responses to the perceptions of teaching questionnaire were analyzed using inductive open coding. Results Results indicated that after the implementation the pre-service teachers significantly improved their understanding of GCC across all items in the content questionnaire, saw several benefits of and challenges about teaching GCC, and perceived themselves as better prepared to teach about GCC in their future classrooms. Conclusions Teacher education programs should integrate inquiry-based GCC instruction to increase pre-service teachers’ knowledge as well as their preparedness to teach about this important planetary issue. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",global climate change; inquiry-based learning; Science education; socio-scientific issues,,,,,,,,,,"Namdar, B.; Department of Mathematics and Science Education, Turkey; email: bahadir.namdar@erdogan.edu.tr",,,Routledge,,,,,2635143,,,,English,Res.

In doing so, it makes the necessary links between the interconnected goals of addressing underlying determinants of Indigenous health and supporting the resurgence of Indigenous knowledges and ways of being toward ensuring planetary well-being more generally. As a means of negotiating this critical interface, three pedagogical capabilities of TSE (Scaling DEEP, Scaling OUT, and Scaling UP) are briefly outlined. Having laid this theoretical groundwork, this article (Part 1) focuses primarily on the role of the transformative sustainability educator in Scaling DEEP (effecting cultural and relational transformation from a de-colonial perspective) as a necessary precursor to the interrelated domains of Scaling OUT and UP (programming and policy change). © The Author(s) 2018.",indigenous health disparities; pedagogy; sustainability,,,,,,,,,,"Williams, L.; Whakauae Research Services, Community House, 60 Ridgway Street, New Zealand; email: lewis@whakauae.co.nz",,,SAGE Publications Inc.,,,,,15413446,,,,English,J.

The curriculum requires both the student to acquire knowledge and skills, but also the personal development for active citizenship. This “dual perspective” might be a complex task to embrace for a teacher, but it is not well described in research. Case studies of four Danish geography teachers were conducted, including interviews and classroom observations. The findings revealed the teachers had strikingly different ways of teaching the topic, which aligned with their orientations and beliefs. The teachers also emphasised the dual perspective to various degrees, including a knowledge dimension and students’ commitment and visions for the future.

For this sample, domain-specific content knowledge about climate change was a significant predictor of students' risk perception of climate change while cultural worldviews (individualism, hierarchy) and political orientation were not. These results contrast with previous studies highlighting worldviews as a dominant influence on risk perception. At the beginning of the semester, students' climate change content knowledge was relatively low, with average scores on a 21-item test less than 50%. Post instruction results indicated that students learned climate change science during the course, and their perceptions of risks associated with climate change increased. Unlike most prior research evaluating links between climate change knowledge and risk perception, our measure of content knowledge was a validated assessment specific to climate change. Use of this specific climate knowledge test may be one reason that we detected a relationship between climate knowledge and risk perception whereas most of the previous research has not. Another—possibly complementary—explanation may be a generational shift between our study sample and prior samples. Undergraduates today, having grown up with more exposure to climate change in schools and the media than previous generations, may be diverging from average adults in that learning climate science appears to also increase their perceptions of the risks climate change poses. Undergraduate courses with embedded climate-related activities present an opportunity to both increase climate science knowledge and risk perceptions of future decision makers. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",climate change; risk perception; undergraduate students,Decision making; Earth (planet); Risk assessment; Risk perception; Students; Teaching; Climate change risks; Climate science; Content knowledge; Domain specific; Perceptions of risks; Political orientation; Undergraduate Courses; Undergraduate students; Climate change,,,,,,,,,"McNeal, K.S.; Department of Geosciences, 2050 Beard Eaves Coliseum, United States; email: karen.mcneal@auburn.edu",,,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,,,,,224308,,JRSTA,,English,J.

The goal was to show how differing climate education technologies succeed and fail at getting students to evolve in their understanding of anthropogenic global climate change (AGCC). Many available climate education technologies aim to convey key AGCC concepts or Earth systems processes; the educational GCM used here aims to teach students the methods and processes of global climate modeling. We hypothesized that challenges to learning about AGCC make authentic technology-enabled inquiry important in developing accurate understandings of not just the issue but how scientists research it. The goal was to determine if student learning trajectories differed between the comparison and treatment groups based on whether each climate education technology allowed authentic scientific research. We trace learning trajectories using pre/post exams, practice quizzes, and written student reflections. To examine the reasons for differing learning trajectories, we discuss student pre/post questionnaires, student exit interviews, and 535 min of recorded classroom video. Students who worked with a GCM demonstrated learning trajectories with larger gains, higher levels of engagement, and a better idea of how climate scientists conduct research. Students who worked with simpler climate education technologies scored lower in the course because of lower levels of engagement with inquiry processes that were perceived to not actually resemble the work of climate scientists. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Climate change; Education; Global climate modeling; Inquiry-based learning,,,,,,"McGill University, McGill",This research was supported by a McGill Tomlinson Fellowship in University Science,,,"Bush, D.; Department of Geography, Room 705 Burnside Hall Building, 805 Sherbrooke Street West, Canada; email: drew.bush@mail.mcgill.ca",,,Springer Netherlands,,,,,10590145,,,,English,J.

Similarly, little research has focused on agricultural audiences, who are among the most vulnerable to and least accepting of climate change. Among 950 high school agriculture students in North Carolina, we found agriculture and environment framing of climate change, but not community and health frames, elicited feelings of worry, and these together with community frames elicited hope. Further, students feeling more worry were more supportive of individual and collective action. Those accepting climate change and females had more emotive responses and higher support for all action measures, and acceptance of human causes predicted more worry and support for collective action.

To understand the global carbon cycle, students will require interdisciplinary knowledge. While standards documents in science education have long promoted interdisciplinary understanding, our current science education system is still oriented toward single-discipline-based learning. Furthermore, there is limited work on interdisciplinary assessment. This article presents the validated Interdisciplinary Science Assessment of Carbon Cycling (ISACC), and reports empirical results of a study of high school and undergraduate students, including an analysis of the relationship between interdisciplinary items and disciplinary items. Many-faceted Rasch analysis produced detailed information about the relative difficulty of items and estimates of ability levels of students. One-way ANCOVA was used to analyze differences among three grade levels: high school, college Freshman–Sophomore, college Junior–Senior, with number of science courses as a covariate. Findings indicated significantly higher levels of interdisciplinary understanding among the Freshman–Sophomore group compared to high school students. There was no statistically significant difference between Freshman–Sophomore group and Junior–Senior group. Items assessing interdisciplinary understanding were more difficult than items assessing disciplinary understanding of global carbon cycling; however, interdisciplinary and disciplinary understanding were strongly correlated.

Strengthening the competencies of multipliers is one goal on the way to ensuring inclusive, quality education for all and to empowering everyone to support sustainable development. Thus, teacher education has to be taken into account - implementing education for sustainable development will depend not least on competent and committed teachers who are motivated to act as change agents. This goes hand in hand with the question of what knowledge and abilities teachers should acquire in order to be active change agents and what is needed to make the development of appropriate competencies possible. But how can teacher education respond to this challenge? To answer this question, the authors introduce and analyze the design of an open learning environment based on the idea of living laboratories. In this setting students work on sustainability issues together with experienced practice partners from school in a transdisciplinary manner on real-world projects.

Using an intrinsic case study methodology, we focused analytic attention on how one teacher made particular pedagogical and content decisions, and the implications for student’s conceptual learning. Using anthropological theories of conceptual travel, we traced salient ideas through instructional delivery and into student reasoning. Analysis showed that students gained an increased understanding of the enhanced greenhouse effect and the implications of human activity on this enhanced effect at statistically significant levels and with moderate effect sizes. However, students demonstrated a limited, though non-significant gain on the likely effects of climate change. Student reasoning on the tangible actions to deal with these problems also remained underdeveloped, reflecting omissions in both PD and teacher enactment.

It is funded by the Spanish R&D+i Program. The objective of the project is to establish a framework to facilitate the training of graduates capable of leading the resolution of challenges in our society through the integration of sustainability training in the Spanish University System. For the training of graduates, it is essential to train teachers beforehand, since most of them do not possess competencies in sustainability. The EDINSOST project involves fifty-five researchers from ten Spanish Universities. It encompasses five engineering degrees and three degrees related to the three dimensions of sustainability, given their great impact on the short-term challenges confronting society. In view of its multiplier and long-term effect, the project also includes the Bachelor and Master’s degrees of five Education degrees, because graduates from these courses will be the future teachers of new generations of citizens. To achieve its objectives, the project has defined a sustainability competency map for thirteen degrees in the fields of education and engineering. On the basis of this map, the most appropriate didactic strategies for sustainability training will be established, the state of the sustainability training requirements in teachers and students will be diagnosed, and finally, proposals will be made for training both groups. In this paper, the objectives of the EDINSOST project are presented, as well as some results of the first objective: the sustainability competency map for engineering degrees.

Studies show that students tend to compartmentalize carbon movement within plants and animals and are challenged to make sense of how carbon cycles on a global scale. Studies also show that students hold faulty models of climate change which thwart their reasoning about how and why climate change occurs. Very few studies have examined how to support students in understanding carbon cycling and reasoning about the relationships between carbon cycling and climate change. To support secondary students in making these connections, we developed a modeling-centered socio-scientific issue (SSI) based curriculum unit taught by the same teacher across three sections of a secondary biology class. At three time points within the 2-week unit, 50 students developed, used, evaluated, and revised their own carbon cycling models to use as sense-making tools for how individual biological processes create a global carbon system and the relationship between carbon cycling and climate change. A small subset of students (n = 16) were also interviewed about their models. We constructed holistic scoring rubrics to document students’ model-based reasoning associated with each model and then compared rubric scores across time points to examine potential progression of model-based reasoning over the course of the unit. Results suggest that students’ must hold a robust understanding of causal mechanisms for transfer and transformation of carbon in order to make connections between carbon cycling and climate change. Once their understanding of carbon cycling becomes robust, their reasoning shifts in complexity to understand interrelationships between carbon cycling and climate change. Implications from this study suggest that embedding the practices of modeling within a SSI unit supported secondary students in building robust understanding of carbon cycling and the interrelationship to climate change. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this first paper of a two-part series, we review the state of the geoscience education research field related to systems thinking in the context of Earth systems. The purpose of this study is to build on previous syntheses by conducting a configurative literature review that addresses the following research questions: (1) What are the characteristics of studies that address systems thinking in the context of Earth systems? (2) What conceptual frameworks for systems are present in the geoscience education research literature on systems thinking in the context of Earth systems? (3) How are these conceptual frameworks operationalized in research and educational interventions aimed at understanding and supporting systems thinking in the context of Earth systems? Twenty-seven papers met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Content analysis was conducted on each of these papers, and systems ideas were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Four conceptual frameworks were identified: Earth systems perspective, Earth systems thinking skills, complexity sciences, and authentic complex Earth and environmental systems. This study is, to our knowledge, the first systematic review in this area and allows a more consistent comparison of new findings with previous work. It also facilitates strengthening connections with cognitive science and education research literature related to systems thinking and complex systems. © Nat. Assoc. Geosci.

The style of research proposed to tackle unsustainability issues should be characterized by the application of a systems approach, as well as transdisciplinarity, participation, generation of social learning and a problem-solving perspective. However, whether such traits are being actually implemented has not been determined. Furthermore, a mature science is expected to have coherent research typologies, besides a scientific community and shared theoretical assumptions and methodological prescriptions; such types or research on sustainability science is still unknown. This systematic review aimed at analyzing research papers on sustainability carried out in 2013. Three aspects were studied: the scientific community, the theoretical assumptions on the concept of sustainability and the methodological design. Results suggest that the scientific community comes from disciplines different to sustainability, the researchers tend not to define the concept of sustainability and among those who do, and there is a lack of shared assumptions. The present analysis also showed that research on sustainability has not implemented the methodological characteristics mentioned and coherent method typologies were not found. These aspects hinder sustainability science evolution and maturity, given the difficulty to construct theories and consolidate a scientific community that develops coherent methods on such grounds. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Epistemology; Methodology; Paradigm; Principles; Sustainability science,interdisciplinary approach; learning; methodology; participatory approach; research program; sustainability,,,,,,,,,"Salas-Zapata, W.A.; Research Group on Health and Sustainability, Calle 70 No. 52-21, Of. 5-103, University Campus, Colombia; email: walter.salas@udea.edu.co",,,Springer Netherlands,,,,,1387585X,,EDSNB,,English,Environ.

We examined 152 refereed publications and proceedings from academic conferences and selected 26 cases of inquiry learning that overcome specific challenges to AGCC teaching. This review identifies both the strengths and weaknesses of each of these case studies. It is the first to go beyond examining the impact of specific inquiry instructional approaches to offer a synthesis of cases. We find that inquiry teaching can succeed by concretising scientific processes, providing access to global data and evidence, imparting critical and higher order thinking about AGCC science/policy and contextualising learning with places and scientific facts. We recommend educational researchers and scientists collaborate to create and refine curricula that utilise geospatial technologies, climate models and communication technologies to bring students into contact with scientists, climate data and authentic AGCC research processes. Many available science education technologies and curricula also require further research to maximise trade-offs between implementation and training costs and their educational value. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",anthropogenic global climate change; Inquiry teaching; university level,,,,,,"McGill University, McGill

However, the controversial nature of the topic can be daunting and many teachers share misconceptions that lead to weak treatment of climate change in classrooms. Nevertheless, numerous teachers have embraced the topic and are providing illustrations of deliberate climate change education. In this study we investigated teacher motivation using focus groups with middle school teachers who currently teach climate change. Qualitative analysis of the collective teacher voices yielded underlying motivations. Our findings suggest that these teachers’ interest in environmentalism naturally translates to climate change advocacy and motivates teaching the topic. Their knowledge and expertise gives them confidence to teach it. These teachers see themselves as scientists, therefore their views align with the scientific consensus. They practice authentic scientific research with their students, thus confirming valued characteristics of their scientist identity. Finally, our findings suggest that teaching climate change gives these teachers a sense of hope as they impact the future through their students.

This research was conducted among 36 students (Grades 7-9) at a school in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The developed PGO and interviews were utilised as the primary data collection techniques. Meanwhile, a constant comparative procedure was employed in the qualitative data analysis. Results showed that the use of PGO assisted students’ visualisation in relating three essential understandings of the global warming issue. The students were able to: 1) identify anthropogenic factor affecting global warming; 2) clarify the effects of global warming in health aspect, and 3) provide alternative solutions regarding green technology and daily practices.

States have been considering whether they will formally adopt, or less formally adapt, the new national science education standards, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), which have been carefully developed and articulated in conjunction with state education leaders. However, there are many challenges with which states, school districts, and teachers must grapple to enact standards-aligned ESS science lessons. This study of one Great Plains state investigated how school districts provide ESS education at the high school level and to what degree is ESS being taught by qualified teachers. We found that 76% of districts added ESS topics to existing physical science and/or biology courses rather than offer a stand-alone ESS course. During the eight-year period investigated, the state awarded 901 science teaching endorsements to either new secondary teachers of which only 3.3% were single-subject ESS endorsements. In Phase I and II of our study we found that only 7% of science teachers teach ESS with an ESS endorsement versus a general science or other science subject area endorsement. When teachers teach ESS out-of-field they lack the confidence and subject matter knowledge to teach effectively using inquiry-based approaches and are less likely to recognize misconceptions and oversimplification of ESS content. © 2017 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.",Earth and space science education; Science teacher endorsement; Secondary science; State science teacher licensing policies,Earth science; secondary education; student; teacher training; Great Plains,,,,,"University of Nebraska-Lincoln, UNL","This project was supported by a University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), Office of Research, Layman Seed Grant.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents and reflects on the specific case of EVS, including its competence-based approach and educational staff roles. Particular attention is paid to the development of ESD competences of tutors through participation in EVS, based on the UNECE (2011) competence framework and supported by the results from a small-scale questionnaire. Three major aspects of EVS as a professional opportunity in ESD are elaborated: EVS as an on-the-job training opportunity, EVS as an international staff mobility opportunity and EVS as an active learning and innovation community. Findings: EVS is an effective opportunity for developing a range of ESD competences, especially for junior university staff. The contribution of EVS to professional development in ESD currently extends to a partnership of ten universities from across Europe, but given its features, the EVS approach has the potential to be adopted at a much larger scale. Possible limitations in scaling up are rigid rules for integration of new courses in curricula and the need to form new EVS-like partnerships. Practical implications: This case study of EVS shows that Web-based, internationally networked courses with a pedagogical approach and design focused on ESD have a large potential in providing effective opportunities for the development of teachers’ ESD competences, but to realize this potential, active uptake of the approach by the existing networks for ESD in higher education is needed. Originality/value: The paper presents a promising option to address the observed lack of opportunities within university curricula to acquire and practice ESD competences for teaching staff. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Competences; ESD; Higher education; Professional development; Virtual seminar,,,,,,,,,,"de Kraker, J.; Faculty of Management, Netherlands; email: jkr@ou.nl",,,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,,,,,14676370,,,,English,Int.

Efforts to transform our societies must thus prioritise the education of educators – building their understanding of sustainability and their ability to transform curriculum and wider learning opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to focus on university educators and critically review the professional development and policy landscape challenges that influence their effective engagement with Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The paper is informed by a pan-European collaboration involving 33 countries that identified emerging scholarship and practice in this area and assessed the lessons learned from ESD professional development initiatives. It sets the context for a special issue titled “Professional Development in Higher Education for Sustainable Development” that draws together a collection of articles focusing on professional development of university educators across the world. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a critical review of existing practice, international policy frameworks and literature relating to ESD, professional development and higher education. It examines innovative initiatives worldwide that seek to improve the capability of educators in higher education to integrate ESD into academic practice at individual, disciplinary and institutional levels. A rigorous process of selection was applied and overseen by an international expert group. This ensured that the initiatives sought educational change in ESD, and not simply the embedding of content about sustainability into learning opportunities. It also assured that the initiatives had a clear and intentional professional learning process to underpin the engagement of participants with ESD. Findings: ESD has grown in visibility and status worldwide, with a clear increase in activity in higher education. The sector is viewed as a significant force for change in societies, through the education provision it offers to future professionals and leaders in all sectors. However, universities currently lack capacity to integrate ESD effectively into mainstream teaching practices and the training they provide for academic staff or to integrate ESD into their institutional teaching and learning priorities. Many ESD activities remain focused on teaching issues arising in sustainable development research and delivering specialist modules or courses in sustainability. Very few countries and institutions have significant staff development programmes to enhance the ESD competences of university educators and build their academic leadership capabilities for ESD. The contributions to this special issue show the need for greater understanding of the multi-level task of integrating ESD into professional development activities, not just for individual impact in the classroom but to advance institutional change and decisively influence the teaching and learning discourse of higher education. Originality/value: There are few research studies and documented activities on ESD professional development in higher education available in the literature. This paper attempts to explore what ESD professional development involves and describes its complexity within the higher education sector. The special issue provides a collection of innovative research and practical initiatives that can help those involved in education and learning to develop ESD as a priority for future university innovative pathways. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Curriculum change; Education for Sustainable Development; Higher education; Professional development; University educators,,,,,,,,,,"Mader, M.; Leuphana University of LüneburgGermany; email: marlene.mader@leuphana.de",,,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,,,,,14676370,,,,English,Int.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research process was used, which consisted of two main phases: a documentary analysis of the internationally accepted frameworks about professional competencies in ES and complexity and a case study. The context was the Learning Camp of Cistercian Monasteries (Catalonia, Spain), and two educators participated in this camp. Findings: The main outcomes are: a framework of professional competencies in ES from a complexity perspective, called CESC, and a rubric, as an assessment tool for professional competences in ES. Originality/value: Based on the results, the author’s can state that this research is a contribution to the ES competency approach and it rectifies the lack of assessment tools in this area. The CESC is a theoretical contribution that facilitates educators’ development of ES competencies based on complexity. The design of the rubric with a high level of applicability and transferability is a methodological contribution which facilitates the assessment of these competencies by educators, as individuals, and educational teams.

My approach is interdisciplinary and I discuss especially the connections between EE and eco-psychology. Based on psychological research, I argue that the wide-scale unconscious anxiety, which people experience, should be taken very seriously in EE. My discussion thus contributes in a new kind of way to a long-standing key issue in EE, the gap between people’s values and the perceived action. Scholars of ecoanxiety have argued that instead of not caring, many people in fact care too much, and have to resort to psychological defenses of denial and disavowal. Thus, the question in EE is not anymore whether EE should deal with anxiety, for anxiety is already there. The prevailing attitude in EE writing is right in emphasizing positive matters and empowerment, but the relation between hope and optimism must be carefully thought about and a certain sense of tragedy must be included. Therefore, my article participates in the discussion about the role of ‘fear appeals’ in EE. My discussion is directed to anyone who wants to understand the reasons for inaction and the ways in which these may be overcome. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Conservation psychology; Ecopsychology; Education for sustainable development; Environmental education; Environmental ethics; Hope and optimism; Sustainability education; Tragedy,,,,,,,,,,"Pihkala, P.; Faculty of Theology, P.O.

Using an iterative process, we developed an empirically grounded learning progression that captures how elementary students use systemic reasoning to explain interactions in ecosystems. This learning progression contains five reasoning patterns: anthropomorphic reasoning, concrete practical reasoning, simple causal reasoning, semi-complex causal reasoning, and complex causal reasoning. The results also show that many students exhibited mixed-level reasoning, meaning that they used reasoning patterns at multiple levels to construct a single response.

We analyse several college divestment campaigns to illuminate key factors that have contributed to wins and rejections, and explore why students continue to organise for FFD. It is our contention that such widespread mobilisation for FFD signals a sea change, from individualised sustainability efforts to youth-led collective political action, and recognition of climate change as a social justice issue. In addition to participant observation, we gathered data from 23 survey responses of organisers involved in divestment campaigns within higher education, and 40 interviews with individuals including student and professional organisers within the FFD movement, institutional decision-makers at campuses with FFD campaigns, and other experts in the area. Our analysis also reveals that relatively smaller endowments and, more importantly, institutional values of environmental sustainability and social justice played key roles in colleges’ decision to divest. Our examination of divestment “losses” illuminates common arguments administrators deploy in their rejection statements, including the perceived costs of divestment, the need to maintain fiduciary responsibility, and scepticism that divestment will have any impact on the fossil fuel industry. Finally, in spite of increasing resistance from college and university administrations, student divestment campaigns continue to escalate, and are committed to organising over the long term. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",climate justice; environmental justice; fossil fuel divestment; student movements; sustainability in higher education,climate change; collective action; energy market; fossil fuel; higher education; industrial investment; social justice; social movement; student; sustainability; United States,,,,,,,,,"Sarathy, B.; Associate Professor of Environmental Analysis, United States; email: brinda_sarathy@pitzer.edu",,,Routledge,,,,,13549839,,,,English,Local Environ.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922963056

Twenty-seven variables were examined by synthesizing 25 polls and 171 academic studies across 56 nations. Two broad conclusions emerged. First, many intuitively appealing variables (such as education, sex, subjective knowledge, and experience of extreme weather events) were overshadowed in predictive power by values, ideologies, worldviews and political orientation.

Data were collected from multiple sources including observations of professional development events, participants’ reflections on their learning, and collection of instructional units designed during the Academy. Data were also collected from a focal case study teacher in a middle school setting. Case study data included classroom observations, teacher interviews, and student beliefs toward climate change. Results indicated that the Climate Academy fostered increased learning among participants of both climate science content and pedagogical strategies for teaching about climate change. Additionally, results indicated that participants applied their new learning in the design of climate change instructional units.

In the light of certain arguments put forward by the aforesaid community, the EU has recommended a set of innovative reforms to science teaching such as incorporating environmental issues into the scientific curriculum, thereby helping to make schools a place of civic education. However, despite these European recommendations, relatively little emphasis is still given to climate change within science curricula. Climate change, although potentially engaging for students, is a complex topic that poses conceptual difficulties and emotional barriers, as well as epistemological challenges. Whilst the conceptual and emotional barriers have already been the object of several studies, students’ reactions to the epistemological issues raised by climate changes have so far been rarely explored in science education research and thus are the main focus of this paper. This paper describes a study concerning the implementation of teaching materials designed to focus on the epistemological role of ‘models and the game of modelling’ in science and particularly when dealing with climate change. The materials were implemented in a course of 15 hours (five 3-hour lessons) for a class of Italian secondary-school students (grade 11; 16–17 years old). The purpose of the study is to investigate students’ reactions to the epistemological dimension of the materials, and to explore if and how the material enabled them to develop their epistemological knowledge on models. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",climate change; epistemology; models and modelling in science; Science education; secondary-school students,,,,,,,,,,"Tasquier, G.; Physics and Astronomy Department, Italy; email: giulia.tasquier@gmail.com",,,Routledge,,,,,9500693,,,,English,Int.

The data was subjected to thematic analysis using Chi and Roscoe's conceptual change framework. The results showed that the students base knowledge of climate change is composed of incomplete and incorrect elements built within coherent and structurally sound mental models. Due to the consistency of the models in expanding the logic, albeit erroneous, of explaining the climate change conundrum, it is posited that students are unaware of mistakes inherent in their judgements. Transformation of these mental models through multiple and deliberate refutations should be foremost in a geography teacher's pedagogical approach. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",climate change; Geography education; mental models; misconceptions; Singapore,climate change; conceptual framework; education; geographical knowledge; human geography; mental health; nature-society relations; perception; questionnaire survey; student; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia],,,,,,,,,"Chang, C.-H.; Graduate Studies and Professional Learning, Singapore; email: chewhung.chang@nie.edu.sg",,,Routledge,,,,,10382046,,,,English,Int.

However, research suggests that these efforts can backfire by breeding despair, denial and inaction. This may be especially true among younger audiences, as despair is highest among those who view climate challenges as out of their control, and children generally have lower perceived and actual control than adults in political and personal arenas. Though many studies have documented feelings of despair and sadness among younger audiences, few have explored how climate change hope may counteract despair and encourage productive responses to climate change concern. This study examined how climate change hope, despair, and concern predict pro-environmental behavior with a quantitative survey of a random sample of middle school students in North Carolina, USA (n = 1486). We did not find an interaction between climate change hope and concern or despair, but instead found climate change hope and concern independently and positively related to behavior and despair negatively related to behavior. These results suggest that climate change concern among K-12 audiences may be an important antecedent to behavior which does not dampen the positive impacts of hope. Further, rather than mitigating the negative effects of climate change despair, hope may be an independent predecessor to behavior. Students at Title I (a measure of low socioeconomic status) schools were less likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, suggesting climate literacy efforts should target schools with lower levels of socioeconomic status specifically. © 2016 by the authors.",Climate action; Climate literacy; Concern; Hope; Pro-environmental behavior,adolescence; antecedent conditions; climate change; human behavior; literacy; socioeconomic status; young population; North Carolina; United States,,,,,,,,,"Stevenson, K.; Wildlife and Conservation Biology Program, United States; email: kathryn_stevenson@ncsu.edu",,,MDPI AG,,,,,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956701449

Where findings may influence important resource-allocation decisions in policy or practice, there is a need for a high degree of reliability when reviewing evidence. However, traditional literature reviews are susceptible to a number of biases during the identification, selection, and synthesis of included studies (e.g., publication bias, selection bias, and vote counting). Systematic reviews, pioneered in medicine and translated into conservation in 2006, address these issues through a strict methodology that aims to maximize transparency, objectivity, and repeatability. Systematic reviews will always be the gold standard for reliable synthesis of evidence. However, traditional literature reviews remain popular and will continue to be valuable where systematic reviews are not feasible. Where traditional reviews are used, lessons can be taken from systematic reviews and applied to traditional reviews in order to increase their reliability. Certain key aspects of systematic review methods that can be used in a context-specific manner in traditional reviews include focusing on mitigating bias; increasing transparency, consistency, and objectivity, and critically appraising the evidence and avoiding vote counting. In situations where conducting a full systematic review is not feasible, the proposed approach to reviewing evidence in a more systematic way can substantially improve the reliability of review findings, providing a time- and resource-efficient means of maximizing the value of traditional reviews. These methods are aimed particularly at those conducting literature reviews where systematic review is not feasible, for example, for graduate students, single reviewers, or small organizations. © 2015, Society for Conservation Biology.",Evidence assessments; Evidence reviews; Meta-analysis; Rapid assessments; Rapid reviews,assessment method; conservation management; feasibility study; literature review; meta-analysis; reliability analysis; resource allocation; strategic approach; theoretical study; environmental protection; literature; procedures; Conservation of Natural Resources; Review Literature as Topic,,,,,"Natural Environment Research Council, NERC: NE/L011506/1",,,,"Haddaway, N.R.; MISTRA EviEM, Lilla Frescativägen 4A, Sweden; email: neal_haddaway@hotmail.com",,,Blackwell Publishing Inc.,,,,,8888892,,CBIOE,26032263,English,Conserv.

Initial content analysis allowed deconstruction of drawings into salient features, with grouping of these features via factor analysis. A resulting 4-factor solution explains 62% of the data variance, suggesting that 4 archetype models of the greenhouse effect dominate thinking within this population. Factor scores, indicating the extent to which each student's drawing aligned with representative models, were compared to performance on conceptual understanding and attitudes measures, demographics, and non-cognitive features of drawings. Student drawings were also compared to drawings made by scientists to ascertain the extent to which models reflect more sophisticated and accurate models. Results indicate that student and scientist drawings share some similarities, most notably the presence of some features of the most sophisticated non-scientific model held among the study population.

Production agriculture in the US is becoming increasingly complex and challenging in the face of a rapidly changing climate and the need to balance growing crop productivity with environmental protection. Simultaneously, extension budgets are diminishing and extension personnel are stretched thin with numerous, diverse stakeholders and decreasing budgets. Evidence from surveys of farmers suggests that they are more likely to go to private retailers and consultants for information than extension. This paper explores the role that extension can play in facilitating climate change adaptation in agriculture using data from a survey of agricultural advisors in Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Nebraska and a survey of extension educators in the 12 state North Central Region. Evidence from these surveys shows that a majority of extension educators believe that climate change is happening and that they should help farmers prepare. It also shows that private agricultural advisors trust extension as a source of information about climate change. This suggests that extension needs to continue to foster its relationship with private information providers because working through them will be the best way to ultimately reach farmers with climate change information. However extension educators must be better informed and trained about climate change; university specialists and researchers can play a critical role in this training process. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,Agriculture; Budget control; Education; Information dissemination; Surveys; Changing climate; Climate change adaptation; Crop productivity; Nebraska; Private information providers; Production agriculture; Rural community; Training process; Climate change,,,,,2011-68002-30220,,,,"Prokopy, L.S.; Purdue UniversityUnited States",,,Kluwer Academic Publishers,,,,,1650009,,CLCHD,,English,Clim.

We discuss the literature on policy mobility as well as overview concerns regarding neoliberalism and education. The paper brings these analyses to bear in considering the uptake of sustainability in education policy. We ask to what extent sustainability as a vehicular idea may be twinning with processes of neoliberalization in education policy in ways that may undermine aspirations of, and action on, environmental sustainability. Toward the end of the paper, we draw on data from an empirical study to help elucidate how the analytic frames of policy mobility can inform our analyses of the potential concerns and possibilities of sustainability as a vehicular idea. In particular, we investigate how sustainability and related language have been adopted in the policies of Canadian post-secondary education institutions over time.

In this paper, we investigated how middle and high school students (N = 512) construct a scientific argument based on evidence from computational models with which they simulated climate change. We designed scientific argumentation tasks with three increasingly complex dynamic climate models. Each scientific argumentation task consisted of four parts: multiple-choice claim, openended explanation, five-point Likert scale uncertainty rating, and open-ended uncertainty rationale. We coded 1,294 scientific arguments in terms of a claim’s consistency with current scientific consensus, whether explanations were model based or knowledge based and categorized the sources of uncertainty (personal vs. scientific). We used chi-square and ANOVA tests to identify significant patterns. Results indicate that (1) a majority of students incorporated models as evidence to support their claims, (2) most students used model output results shown on graphs to confirm their claim rather than to explain simulated molecular processes, (3) students’ dependence on model results and their uncertainty rating diminished as the dynamic climate models became more and more complex, (4) some students’ misconceptions interfered with observing and interpreting model results or simulated processes, and (5) students’ uncertainty sources reflected more frequently on their assessment of personal knowledge or abilities related to the tasks than on their critical examination of scientific evidence resulting from models. These findings have implications for teaching and research related to the integration of scientific argumentation and modeling practices to address complex Earth systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Argumentation; Computational modeling, Earth systems, climate change; Instructional technology; Online learning",,,,,,"DRL-0929774, DRL-1220756

This study reports on the impact of a technology-enhanced unit designed to improve understanding of global climate change, its mechanisms, and their relationship to everyday energy use. Global Climate Change, implemented in the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE), engages sixth-grade students in conducting virtual investigations using NetLogo models to foster an understanding of core mechanisms including the greenhouse effect. Students then test how the greenhouse effect is enhanced by everyday energy use. This study draws on three data sources: (1) pre- and post-unit interviews, (2) analysis of embedded assessments following virtual investigations, and (3) contrasting cases of two students (normative vs. non-normative understanding of the greenhouse effect). Results show the value of using virtual investigations for teaching the mechanisms associated with global climate change. Interviews document that students hold a wide range of ideas about the mechanisms driving global climate change. Investigations with models help students use evidence-based reasoning to distinguish their ideas. Results show that understanding the greenhouse effect offers a foundation for building connections between everyday energy use and increases in global temperature. An impediment to establishing coherent understanding was the persistence of an alternative conception about ozone as an explanation for climate change. These findings illustrate the need for regular revision of curriculum based on classroom trials. We discuss key design features of models and instructional revisions that can transform the teaching and learning of global climate change. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Everyday energy use; Global climate change; Mechanisms; Models; Virtual investigations,,,,,,"0822388

It also reveals the difficulties and obstacles that graduates encounter in their professional careers to promote pro-environmental strategies in their companies or to maintain sustainable behaviours. Information for the qualitative research was obtained from semi-structured interviews with 70 graduates from eight assorted faculties spread across three campuses at the University of Zaragoza. The paper categorises the most widely detected barriers impeding the application of pro-environmental strategies in the workplace and considers whether these barriers are connected with university education. One of the most relevant conclusions is that a small number of graduates were involved in pro-environmental strategies and only when such strategies were promoted and developed by the firm itself. In these cases the graduates felt that they had been well prepared at the University. However, the majority had not participated in pro-environmental strategies and felt that their university education did not equip them properly for their involvement in environmental projects. This barrier is thus considered a very significant one. A previous research study developed with the same graduates tested a causal model that explained environmental attitudes and their connection with environmental behaviour. In the model, the intention or willingness to act came between attitudes and behaviours. In this work, the unwillingness to act is also shown to be a significant barrier to participating in pro-environmental strategies. As a conclusion, changes are suggested in the curriculum to include core competencies in sustainability in all degrees. It is also proposed that firms and universities establish organisational structures to promote effective sustainability and pro-environmental actions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicate that adolescents currently conflate climate change mitigation strategies with unrelated environmental problems far less than in previous surveys.

The first part of this article describes the structure of STEM outreach programs for K-12 students and teachers in various parts of the United States. The second part presents, in detail, the structure and results of the outreach program SUCCEED (the Summer Center for Climate, Energy, and Environmental Decision-Making), a K-12 outreach program created by Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Engineering and Public Policy (EPP). SUCCEED aims to 1.) improve scientific literacy through a summer program focusing on climate, energy, and environmental decision making for students entering 10th grade and K-12 teachers; 2.) encourage the pursuit of STEM-related careers, and 3.) help teachers prepare curriculum in these disciplines, to be used in their classes.

The saving of resources and energy is everyone's concern and environmental education is vital to guarantee a sustainable lifestyle in the long run. To find out what similarities and differences in views regarding waste management exist between grammar school pupils and comprehensive school pupils in England, questionnaires were designed and distributed in two schools in the same English city. The questionnaires aimed at quantifying and establishing students' knowledge, attitudes and behaviour regarding waste management. The results illustrate that students from the grammar school had higher levels of knowledge, were more likely to recycle and used more sources of information regarding waste management. Waste reduction was considered important by almost all students. However, students in both schools considered composting and waste reduction as less important than recycling and thereby did not fully agree with sustainable waste management. © by Karin Dorina Kolbe 2015.",education for sustainable development; environmental education; selective education; sustainable development; waste hierarchy; waste management; waste management,,,,,,,,,,"Kolbe, K.D.; University of Koblenz and Landau, Campus Koblenz, ZFUW, Universitaetsstrasse 1, Germany",,,De Gruyter Open Ltd,,,,,16914147,,,,English,J.

I describe the emotional connections and disconnections within and across the three aspects of climate change that students engaged with most deeply: the impacts, lack of action, and causes of climate change. These emotional connections and disconnections provide new ways to understand preservice elementary teachers' emotional sense-making of this scientific issue. Implications for examining features of emotions to make salient emotional sense-making of climate change are discussed.

The Broader Impact requirements for scientists by funding agencies facilitate this connection. We propose and test a model curriculum development process in which scientists, curriculum developers, and classroom educators work together to scaffold the use of authentic, unprocessed scientific data for high school students. We outline a three-module curriculum structure that facilitates these goals. This curriculum engages students in the collection, description, visualization, and interpretation of data; develops understanding of the nature of science; includes prompts to develop higher-order thinking skills; builds knowledge of regional relevance of climate change in students; uses active learning techniques; and can be easily integrated with the Next Generation Science Standards. The curriculum was reviewed and tested in the classroom. To shed further light on the curriculum development process, we gathered reflection data from the scientists, curriculum developers, and educators. Scientists appreciated the collaborative process in which they contributed their expertise without requiring a large time commitment or strong expertise in science education. The curriculum developers viewed the modular structure as helpful in breaking complicated scientific concepts into teachable steps. Classroom educators appreciated the detailed description and step-by-step instructions to navigate data analysis tools like Excel or Google Earth. Initial classroom implementation of the curriculum by 11 teachers with over 1,100 students showed high levels of interest in the topic and engagement. Further work is needed to assess efficacy of the curriculum through classroom observations and measures of student learning. © 2015 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.",Arctic; Broader impacts; Climate education; Curriculum development; Data; Excel; Google earth; Inquiry; Professional development workshop,arctic environment; curriculum; data set; geography education; Internet; learning; physical geography; Arctic,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1107428",,,,"Gold, A.U.; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder, Research Lab 2, UCB 449, United States",,,National Association of Geoscience Teachers Inc.,,,,,10899995,,,,English,J.

Headlines attributing an event solely to either human-induced climate change or natural variability can be misleading when both are invariably in play. The conventional attribution framework struggles with dynamically driven extremes because of the small signal-to-noise ratios and often uncertain nature of the forced changes. Here, we suggest that a different framing is desirable, which asks why such extremes unfold the way they do. Specifically, we suggest that it is more useful to regard the extreme circulation regime or weather event as being largely unaffected by climate change, and question whether known changes in the climate system's thermodynamic state affected the impact of the particular event.

However, despite the declaration of good intentions and policy developments at the national, regional and international level, little has been achieved in terms of embedding education for sustainable development holistically in the curriculum. To date, a number of research studies have focused on the perceptions and views of university students in relation to sustainable development knowledge, skills and competencies; however, few studies have focused on student teachers' perceptions of education for sustainable development. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions and views of a group of thirty-two student teachers in relation to education for sustainable development competencies. The research instrument used was a questionnaire. This study provides evidence on the education for sustainable development (ESD) competencies that student teachers would prioritize in a school project related to ESD: acquisition of knowledge and practical skills related to nature and natural sciences, to the detriment of other types of learning, such as the promotion of ethical values, positive attitudes towards sustainability and the management of emotions among their future primary school students. Existing ESD theoretical frameworks need to become more alive and integrated within the existing teacher education curriculum to promote the awareness and development of ESD competencies amongst student teachers. © 2015 by the authors.",Education for sustainable development; Higher education; Professional competencies; Student perception; Teacher education,education policy; educational development; higher education; perception; policy making; questionnaire survey; student; sustainability; sustainable development; teaching; theoretical study,,,,,,,,,"Junyent, M.; Department of Mathematics and Science Education, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, G5-126 Campus UAB-Bellaterra, Spain",,,MDPI AG,,,,,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926360258

However, sociocultural factors may overshadow these perceptions when people are forced to make personally impacting choices contextualized within actual socioscientific issues. This investigation determined 324 secondary students' perceptions about global warming (GW) science and willingness to mitigate GW across five categories of actions-each requiring varying levels of personal sacrifice (e.g., supporting GW education versus limiting personal reproduction). Identified sociocultural indicators among the students included ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic classification. Results indicate that GW science views and sociocultural factors became less impactful on the participants' willingness to mitigate GW as the GW-mitigating actions required greater personal involvement and sacrifice. However, most consistently significantly predicting willingness to mitigate GW was the participants' perceptions about the validity of GW science claims. Furthermore, while the participants' perceptions about the nature of GW science methods significantly influenced their willingness to enact certain GW-mitigating actions, socioeconomic classification and ethnicity were oftentimes stronger indicators of the participants' inclination to mitigate GW. Implications for education discussed include promoting responsible socioscientific decision making through contextually teaching about how and why GW science is valid while also considering how sociocultural factors can impact socioscientific choices. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1043323",,,,"Herman, B.C.; Department of Teaching and Learning, United States",,,Wiley-Liss Inc.,,,,,368326,,,,English,Sci.

Numerous plausible characterizations of these variations, and explanations for them, are to be found in the literature. However, a clear picture has not yet emerged as to the principal trends and patterns that have occurred over the past quarter-century or the factors behind these changes. This systematic review considers previous empirical research that has addressed the temporal aspects to public perceptions. We address findings that have been obtained since the 1980s and using a range of methodologies. In this review, we consider early, seminal work examining public perceptions; survey studies carried out over long timescales and at an international scale, detailed statistical analyses of the drivers of changing perceptions; and qualitative research featuring a longitudinal component. Studies point to growing skepticism in the latter 2000s in some developed countries, underpinned by economic and sociopolitical factors. Even so, in many parts of the world, there has been growing concern about climate change in recent years. We conclude that the imbalance in the literature toward polling data, and toward studies of public perceptions in Western nations (particularly the United States), leaves much unknown about the progression of public understanding of climate change worldwide. More research is required that uses inferential statistical procedures to understand the reasons behind trends in public perceptions. The application of qualitative longitudinal methodologies also offers the potential for better appreciation of the cultural contexts in which climate change perceptions are evolving.

Our analysis shows how the policy-making process in Flanders is inextricably intertwined with three developments in environmental and educational policy: the increasing impact of ESD policy and discourse on environmental education, the framing of social and political problems as learning problems, and ecological modernisation. These trends give shape to a post-ecologist and post-political policy regime and, thus, affect what is possible and acceptable within Flemish ESD policy. However, this case study also revealed that these developments do not completely determine ESD policy-making in Flanders. Our examination thus allowed us to understand how the actual policy translation in a particular local setting brings about powers that legitimise and maintain as well as counteract the bounds of the policy regime that emerged in the context of the UN Decade. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",ecological modernisation; education for sustainable development; ESD; governmentalisation; policy-making; UN Decade of ESD,,,,,,,,,,"Van Poeck, K.; Laboratory of Education and Society, Belgium",,,Routledge,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

Information is spread by the media, for example, via the Internet or information brochures, employing different representational styles (e.g. sensational vs. neutral styles, emphasis of human vs. natural causes). We investigated the effects of such differences in presentation when informing about local impacts of climate change – more specifically about invasive species – on perceived risk, emotions, and learning. Seventy-two students at a German university read five brochures about the local effects of climate change and invasive species. They rated their perceived risk and emotions and worked on learning outcome tests. As expected, the sensational style led to higher perceived risk and stronger negative emotions than the neutral style. In addition, our results reveal a potential dilemma for environmental education: while a sensational style enhanced general learning outcomes, it seemed to lead to quite a negative and one-sided view about climate change and invasive species. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",climate change communication; emotions; environmental education; invasive species; perception of risk,,,,,,"Ministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Württemberg, MWK: 33-720.281/34","We would like to thank Rolf Schwonke for his methodological assistance in mediation analysis and Anna Sartori for her assistance in rating the open questions.

The qualitative data were scrutinised employing interpretive phenomenological analysis that displayed mostly positive instrumental relationships with mathematics and explicit connections between the teachers' life experiences and their disctinct identity voices that surfaced in interviews. Similarly, teachers appeared to be experts in different professional spheres: pedagogy, subject or didactics. The teachers' accounts contain various models of relationships between the other-motive and the self-motive as reflected in their pedagogical approaches. Emergent patterns resulting from the interaction of the teachers' mathematical identity and their perception of students' mathematical philia/phobia included the humanistic approach with an instrumental interpretation of mathematics and its teaching methods, self-actualisation in achieving success in mathematics through hard work and the issue of attribution of failure in mathematics either to external or internal factors. Moreover, these dialogical models and interactive patterns show alignement with one of the core competences for educators in education for sustainable development, that is, achieving transformation in what it means to be an educator, in teaching and learning, as well as in the entire education system.

For the individual, this gap is probably the result of the huge complexity of factors that affect behaviour. The way in which this gap is sometimes identified in the literature, however, is also partly a function of the fact that much of the research in this area has compared environmental attitudes in general with a willingness to take actions that are specific. In the present study, we have circumvented this latter issue by exploring links between a declared willingness to undertake specific actions and the level of belief in the efficacy of those particular actions in reducing global warming. Here we report findings on actions concerning personal transport. Because the questionnaire was designed to provide quantitative measures, novel indices could be constructed that indicate, for example, the extent to which persuading people that an action is effective might increase their willingness to undertake it. Responses were obtained from students in 11 countries with different cultural mores. This enabled us to explore possible associations between a readiness to undertake specific actions and previously published socio-cultural indices. The implications for education about these issues are explored. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",climate change; cultural differences; environmental action; environmental education; global warming; personal transport,environmental education; environmental management; environmental planning; global warming; perception; student; transportation mode,,,,,,,,,"Stanisstreet, M.; Environmental Education Research Unit, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; email: martstan@liverpool.ac.uk",,,Channel View Publications,,,,,10382046,,,,English,Int.

In this paper, we present the development of an important contribution to these efforts - an Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis (IBPA) Framework. Methods: Developed over the course of two years in consultation with key stakeholders and drawing on best and promising practices of other equity-informed approaches, this participatory and iterative IBPA Framework provides guidance and direction for researchers, civil society, public health professionals and policy actors seeking to address the challenges of health inequities across diverse populations. Importantly, we present the application of the IBPA Framework in seven priority health-related policy case studies. Results: The analysis of each case study is focused on explaining how IBPA: 1) provides an innovative structure for critical policy analysis; 2) captures the different dimensions of policy contexts including history, politics, everyday lived experiences, diverse knowledges and intersecting social locations; and 3) generates transformative insights, knowledge, policy solutions and actions that cannot be gleaned from other equity-focused policy frameworks. Conclusion: The aim of this paper is to inspire a range of policy actors to recognize the potential of IBPA to foreground the complex contexts of health and social problems, and ultimately to transform how policy analysis is undertaken. © 2014 Hankivsky et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Equity; Health; Intersectionality; Policy analysis; Reflexivity,"civil society; conceptual framework; equity; health policy; policy analysis; public health; stakeholder; Article; case study; clinical practice; conceptual framework; consultation; health care policy; health equity; health practitioner; intersectionality based policy analysis framework; knowledge; medical history; methodology; personal experience; politics; population research; priority journal; public health problem; social aspect; social problem; Canada; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; health care disparity; health disparity; health service; health services research; HIV Infections; human; indigenous health care; management; nonbiological model; organization and management; palliative therapy; procedures; serodiagnosis; standards; AIDS Serodiagnosis; Canada; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Health Policy; Health Services, Indigenous; Health Status Disparities; Healthcare Disparities; HIV Infections; Humans; Maternal Health Services; Models, Organizational; Organizational Case Studies; Palliative Care; Policy Making",,,,,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR

Further, increased science literacy may polarize worldview-driven perceptions, making some climate literacy efforts ineffective among skeptics. Because worldviews are still forming in the teenage years, adolescents may represent a more receptive audience. This study examined how worldview and climate change knowledge related to acceptance of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) and in turn, climate change risk perception among middle school students in North Carolina, USA (n = 387). We found respondents with individualistic worldviews were 16.1 percentage points less likely to accept AGW than communitarian respondents at median knowledge levels, mirroring findings in similar studies among adults. The interaction between knowledge and worldview, however, was opposite from previous studies among adults, because increased climate change knowledge was positively related to acceptance of AGW among both groups, and had a stronger positive relationship among individualists. Though individualists were 24.1 percentage points less likely to accept AGW than communitarians at low levels (bottom decile) of climate change knowledge, there was no statistical difference in acceptance levels between individualists and communitarians at high levels of knowledge (top decile). Non-White and females also demonstrated higher levels of AGW acceptance and climate change risk perception, respectively. Thus, education efforts specific to climate change may counteract divisions based on worldviews among adolescents. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Global warming; Anthropogenic global warming; Climate change risks; Knowledge level; Middle school students; North Carolina , USA; Percentage points; Science literacy; Statistical differences; Risk perception",,,,,,,,,"Stevenson, K.T.; Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology Program, Department of Forestry & Environmental Resources, North Carolina State UniversityUnited States",,,Kluwer Academic Publishers,,,,,1650009,,CLCHD,,English,Clim.

We demonstrate that exposure to climate science in an engaging edutainment format changes youths’ knowledge, beliefs, involvement, and behavior positively and moves them to audience segments that are more engaged in the issue. The net impact of scaled, multi-sensory, captivating programs for youth could be a population shift in science-informed engagement in the issue of climate change.

This research adopts a quasi-experimental design, applying WIAS to the teaching of environmental issues, including mudslides, global warming and nuclear power. Fifty-seven elementary school fifth graders from two classes participated in this research. With each class as a unit, they were divided into the WIAS group (n=30) and the traditional argumentation instruction (TAI) group (n=27). Before research, all students took the pre-test of the 'achievement test for environmental issues (ATEI)' and the 'environmental literacy scale (ELS).' Then all students received argumentation training and six classes of argumentation instruction. Students in the WIAS group performed argumentation in the WIAS, while those in the TAI group performed argumentation in a traditional classroom. After the six-class argumentation instruction, all students took the post-test of the ATEI and ELS. The results show that students in the WIAS group have significantly better learning effectiveness than those in the TAI group. Students in the WIAS group also exhibited significantly better improvement in their environmental literacy. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",E-Learning; Environmental education; Web-based argumentation,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, T.H.; Department of Education and Learning Technology, National Hsinchu University of EducationTaiwan",,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,,,2664909,,,,English,J.

The polysemy of the term sustainability has undermined the credibility of the concept, leading, among other effects, to the inability to translate discourse into practical actions and to distortive appropriations of the term. The purpose of this article is to propose a basis for discussion to demarcate the concept. In this context, a literature review was conducted on the theme, encompassing an exploratory approach and a systematic hermeneutics analysis of the literature. Based on a structured discussion of the evidence collected in papers and books, we developed a conceptual model named Sustainable Development with an Axiological Perspective, encompassing three dimensions: satisfaction of human needs (including social and economic aspects), natural resources (making explicit Earth's limitations) and decision-making perspective (from an axiological point of view). The model proposes that sustainable development can be seen as development aimed at improving the well-being of society as a whole (including future generations), enabled by an axiological perspective in decision-making processes, considering the limitations of environmental resources. The model explicitly includes a value-based mindset in the concept of sustainable development, as pointed out by the axiological perspective. This perspective is intrinsic to the main definitions of sustainability, but is not explicit in the models and in the literature on sustainable development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we introduce three components of the effort: curriculum development, teacher professional development, and evaluation. The main focus is on the two-part teacher professional development program, which enables a small group of exemplary teachers, known as EarthLabs ‘‘teacher leaders,’’ who have reviewed and tested the EarthLabs Climate modules (part 1) to lead a summer workshop introducing high school teachers to modules (part 2). Evaluation results from the first workshops held in Texas and Mississippi in summer 2012 reveal that participants appreciated the variety of activities covered, including online resources, individual work, small group work, hands-on activities, outdoor activities, field trips, and scientist lectures. Self-reported content learning and increased confidence in teaching the three main topics was positive for almost all participants. These results, in combination with teacher leaders’ observed pedagogic practice and reported impact of their participation, suggest that the EarthLabs Climate two-part model of teacher professional development is effective. This success is largely because of our support system for teacher leaders to help them plan and deliver summer workshops, as well as the emphasis placed on supporting their continued professional growth. We are confident that EarthLabs Climate teacher leaders are competent to continue to offer professional development to their colleagues and to sustain climate education beyond the current effort.

With this new emphasis in K-12 science education, geoscience educators will likely play a central role in shaping a nation of citizens capable of understanding and making informed decisions about global climate change. In charting a path forward, it is timely to consider the ways in which geoscience educators can be effectively prepared and supported as climate change education leaders. In this article, we analyze the inclusion of climate change in the Next Generation Science Standards and review existing literature on professional development related to climate change education. Literature in this domain underscores the complex nature of climate change, curriculum and instruction challenges related to teaching the topic, recommended practices for teacher education and professional development, and the emerging role of technology integration for addressing climate change in the science classroom. Finally, we present one approach to teacher professional development around climate change education, emphasizing: (1) the need for quality standards-aligned curricular resources to support climate change instruction, especially those that integrate technology; (2) the potential of regional observations-focused learning progressions for making climate change personally relevant to learners; and (3) the value of research-based professional development and teacher education for advancing climate change education. © 2014 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.",Climate change education; Learning progressions; Next Generation Science Standards; Science teacher education,,,,,,,,,,"Hestness, E.; Department of Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership, University of MarylandUnited States",,,National Association of Geoscience Teachers Inc.,,,,,10899995,,,,English,J.

This course was not only designed to help these students understand climate change education, but also to review fundamental Earth, life, and physical science concepts. Students’ knowledge of climate change increased significantly after completing the course. Students’ perceptions about climate change became significantly more aligned to those of climate scientists. Students’ postcourse questionnaires and science journals were analyzed for insights into the effectiveness of the curriculum and instructional approach of the course.

We conducted an in-depth study of the classrooms of the participating teachers. Our results show statistically significant gains from pre- to postassessment in students’ content knowledge and a shift in their opinions about climate change. These gains are positively related to the percentage of students who are engaged and interacting, and negatively related to the percentage of students who are disengaged.

One of the more interesting accounts, from a psychological perspective, is the influence of ideology on climate change beliefs. Previous work suggests that ideology trumps knowledge in shaping climate change beliefs. However, these studies have typically examined the influence of proxy measures of knowledge rather than specific climate change knowledge. The goal of the present research was to provide some clarification on the different influences of knowledge and ideology on beliefs about climate change. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between specific climate change knowledge, hierarchical and individualistic ideology, and climate change belief in a national sample (N=335) of the Australian public. Contrary to research involving proxy knowledge measures, we found that people who had greater knowledge of climate change causes were more willing to accept that climate change is occurring. Furthermore, knowledge of causes attenuated the negative relationship between individualistic ideology and belief that climate change exists. Our findings suggest that climate change knowledge has the potential to positively influence public discourse on the issue. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K001175/1",,,,"Guy, S.; Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, Redmond Barry Building, University of Melbourne, VIC, 3010, Australia; email: s.guy@student.unimelb.edu.au",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,,,462772,,EJSPA,,English,Eur.

We welcome Morsy, Gulson and Clarke's supplementation of the special issue with the genealogical analysis they provide of private school funding in Australia and the attention they draw to elisions of race, ethnicity, Indigeneity and whiteness in contemporary framings of equity in policy and research. We also clarify and expand on some of the aims and arguments that framed the special issue. However, we feel that any response adequate to the 'event' that Morsy, Gulson and Clarke hope to stage - that is, a 'debate redux' and politics of dissensus in education as an antidote to depoliticisation - must extend beyond the rehearsal of pre-existing positions; it cannot stop at endorsing or critiquing the points raised in their paper, or reiterating the rationales and arguments of the special issue. We therefore respond by gesturing towards possibilities for 'disagreement', in the sense that Jacques Ranciere gives this term, about the political vocation of critical policy sociologists, and the modes of doing and being that can be seen as 'critical' and 'political' in academic education research.

It focuses on how learners of climate science understand messages on climate change, the communicative contexts for education on climate change, the barriers that can be found to public engagement with climate change issues, and how these barriers can be addressed. 92 peer-reviewed studies were examined. The analysis focuses on the goals and strategies of CCC, and how barriers can be addressed given the research findings on: (a) the content of CCC, (b) visualizations, (c) framing, (d) audience segmentation. The paper concludes that CCC and education need to address barriers to public engagement on several levels simultaneously. It recommends that scholars of environmental education focus critical attention on how practice addresses senses and spheres of agency; sociocultural factors; and the complexities of developing scientific literacy given the interpretative frames and prior understandings that are brought to bear by the public in non-formal education settings. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",climate change; communication; learning; non-formal education; public engagement; public understanding,,,,,,"Vetenskapsrådet, VR: 2008-1723",This paper was made possible by a grant from the Swedish Research Council for the project Making sense of climate change – a study of the formation and maintenance of social representations (project no. 2008-1723).

Even though digital news consumption has been steadily increasing, particularly among young people (Pew Research Center 2013a), many American adults ages 18 and older still regularly watch local TV news and network TV news (Miller et al. 2006; Pew Research Center 2013b); and the daily weather segment is a perennial favorite among them (Pew Research Center 2013b; Silcock et al. 2006). Furthermore, TV weather reporters are seen as a trusted source of information about climate change by a solid majority (60%) of adult Americans (Leiserowitz et al. 2012). Indeed, TV weather reports are arguably one of the most common voluntarily sought forms of science education in the daily lives of most adult Americans (Wilson 2008). Previous research suggests that weathercasts can be an important and effective venue for informal science education on a wide range of topics such as geography (Earl and Pasternack 1991), public health (Johnson 2009), and hurricane risk (Demuth et al. 2012). © 2014 american meteorological society.",,Climate change; Research; Daily lives; Digital news; Field experiment; Hurricane risk; Informal science education; Research center; Science education; Young peoples; Education,,,,,,,,,"Zhao, X.; Department of Communication, Center for Climate Change Communication, George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, MS 3D6, Fairfax, VA 22030, United States; email: xzhao3@gmu.edu",,,American Meteorological Society,,,,,30007,,BAMIA,,English,Bull.

Sustainability is closely related to complexity, innovation, and interdisciplinarity; therefore, it requires alternative approaches rather than traditional, lecture-based pedagogy. This paper reports an educational initiative and research project based on collaboration between Beijing Normal University, China and Aalborg University, Denmark: developing a sustainability curriculum using the methodology of Problem and Project Based Learning (PBL) in a Chinese context. A theoretical framework is established to understand and analyze the culture's change toward a sustainability curriculum that employs PBL methodology. Empirical work is drawn upon first year results from the implementation of this methodology in an engineering and science curriculum. Data generation is based on multiple collection methods, such as survey of students' feedbacks, interviews with students, and analysis of students' project reports and reflection essays. This paper summarizes that a sustainability curriculum as proposed in this research can attract students' interests in not only mastering relevant knowledge, but also in developing necessary skills and competencies. PBL as a teaching and learning method can successfully facilitate participative learning, critical reflection, systemic thinking, creativity, and cultural awareness, which are the core values of sustainability. However, implementing a new curriculum with new teaching and learning methods can be more complex than expected. Many issues impact the implementation process and are therefore remain challenges to further development; for example, how to change the existing grading system, how to provide both teaching staff and students' with prior knowledge about the new PBL methods, how to gain institutional support, and how to change the broader societal and cultural values. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

About 40% of North American university students take a mainstream introductory economics course; few of these students take economics at more advanced levels. As such, introductory economics courses are an important vehicle for students to learn economic theory; they have the potential to contribute to the knowledge that students can mobilize to foster sustainability. Interviews were held with 54 students who had recently completed an introductory level mainstream economics course at one of the three universities. Students reported that introductory economics courses place little emphasis on the environment and sustainability, they recalled course content with normative connotations that are problematic from a sustainability perspective and they described how discussion of the limitations of mainstream theory was set aside. Student reports of the insights introductory economics offers into environmental problems imply that these courses are failing to substantively increase students' understanding of sustainability and linkages between the environment and the economy. Findings suggest that current introductory economics curriculum undermines the universities' sustainability commitments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Economics education; Student; Sustainability commitment; University,curriculum; economic theory; environmental economics; environmental education; student; sustainability; university sector; British Columbia; Canada,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","Ronald Trosper, Amy Metcalfe, Leila Harris, Patricia (Ellie) Perkins, two anonymous reviewers and the journal's editors provided valuable comments.

However, in Germany, school classes often participate in such 1-day EE programmes because they better match the school curriculum in contrast to longer (residential) programmes. We therefore monitored a 1-day outreach EE programme on global climate change to reveal whether environmental attitudes and/or connectedness with nature of tenth graders are affected. Students from German high schools (college preparatory secondary school level, 'Gymnasium') (N0114) from age 14 to 19 participated in the programme (treatment group). It consisted of two student-centred learning units on the topic of climate change. Additionally, we chose a control group of students who did not participate in the programme. To measure students' environmental attitudes and connectedness with nature, we administered the Two Major Environmental Values (2-MEV) and the Inclusion of Nature in Self scale in a pre-, post- and retention test design. The pre-test was administered 1 week before, the post-test directly after and the retention test 4 to 6 weeks after programme participation. Analyses revealed a positive long-term effect only for utilitarian values (one of the two major environmental factors of 2-MEV) which decreased significantly. Therefore, depending on the programme's content, short-term EE programmes indeed may have an influence on participants' environmental attitudes. © Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada, Lisboa, Portugal and Springer Science+Business Media BV 2012.",Attitudes; Botanical garden; Climate change; Environmental education; Environmental values,,,,,,,,,,"Sellmann, D.; Department of Biology Education, Universitaetsstrasse 30, 95448 Bayreuth, Germany; email: daniela.sellmann@uni-bayreuth.de",,,,,,,,2562928,,,,English,Eur.

In line with this trend, we conducted both assessments and teaching experiments with students from grades 4 to 12 (717 students participated in the pre-assessments and 682 students participated in the post-assessments). The goal of the study is to develop a learning progression framework that provides effective guidance for curriculum and instruction on carbon-transforming processes in socio-ecological systems. We conducted the study in three research cycles. We developed a matter-and-energy learning progression framework during the first two cycles. This learning progression framework was used to guide the teaching intervention in the third research cycle. Clinical interviews and written assessments were implemented before and after the teaching intervention. In the process of data analysis, we found that the matter-and-energy learning progression framework did not provide a fine-grained depiction of students' reasoning. Therefore, we developed the five-practice learning progression framework, and used it to re-analyze data. Results indicate that the teaching intervention has helped students to achieve significant learning gains, but it was not effective enough in helping students achieve the upper anchor of the learning progression framework-constructing sophisticated scientific explanations. The results also indicate that students tended to rely on coherent and consistent reasoning to construct explanations. Based on the findings, we provide instructional suggestions and discuss the implications for climate change education and learning progression research. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Carbon-transforming processes; Learning progression; Scientific practices,,,,,,,,,,"Jin, H.; School of Teaching and Learning, Arps Hall,1945 N.

Yet, traditional education efforts have been inadequate in fostering transformative change, in part because many programs focus on fact-heavy, teacher-centered techniques while neglecting the practices that behavioral and sustainability scholars highlight as central to creating change. To address this gap, the pre-sent research integrates three critical yet mostly disparate bodies of research- educational pedagogy, behavior change, and sustainability competencies. This interdisciplinary ap-proach to education was implemented and evaluated with a small group of students during an intensive summer program and year-long case study. The curriculum focused on food and waste behaviors and utilized experiential, real-world, problem-based methods in order to increase competence in sustainability and promote pro-environmental actions. The im-pact of the program was assessed through surveys, interviews, videos, and participant ob-servations. The data showed that significant changes in knowledge and behaviors were achieved, while suggesting that social knowledge in terms of food is more resistant to change as compared to that of waste. Throughout the year, students maintained significant behavior changes in terms of their waste decisions; however, sustainable food behaviors were more resistant to long-term change due to the students' social and cultural environ-ment.

A framework based on adult learning theories was developed and used to analyse the what, why and how of beef producers' learning to improve land condition. Twenty-eight producers were interviewed face-to-face and another 91 participated in a telephone survey. Most beef producers were motivated to learn due to perceived problems with existing practices and described mainly learning new skills and techniques to improve production. Beef producers main learning sources were their own experiences, observing others' practices and sharing experiences with peers and family members. Results showed that organised collective learning, adversity and active experimentation with natural resource management skills and techniques can facilitate critical reflection of practices, questioning of the self, others and cultural norms and an enhanced sense of environmental responsibility. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Experiential learning; Extension; Farmer; Natural resource management; Social learning; Transformative learning,"adult; agroindustry; cattle; learning; livestock farming; perception; questionnaire survey; resource management; sustainability; article; Australia; beef; case study; environmental sustainability; experimentation; human; interview; learning; meat industry; personal experience; resource management; responsibility; teleconsultation; thinking; Adult; Aged; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Cattle; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cooperative Behavior; Ecosystem; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Queensland; Australia",,,,,"Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO

However, local climate-change experience may play an important role in adaptation and mitigation behaviour and policy support. Previous research indicates that people can perceive and adapt to aspects of climate variability and change based on personal observations. Experience with local weather may also influence global warming beliefs. Here we examine the extent to which respondents in 89 countries detect recent changes in average local temperatures. We demonstrate that public perceptions correspond with patterns of observed temperature change from climate records: individuals who live in places with rising average temperatures are more likely than others to perceive local warming. As global climate change intensifies, changes in local temperatures and weather patterns may be increasingly detected by the global public. These findings also suggest that public opinion of climate change may shift, at least in part, in response to the personal experience of climate change. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In addressing these problems a range of philosophical positions and controversies are considered, including: traditional romantic and institutional views of schooling; and more recent maximalist, neo-liberal, emancipatory and post-modern-perspectives of lifelong learning. In this paper we argue that these do not represent 'the last word' on the provision of learning and the enhancement of life chances and instead we put forward an alternative view based upon the notion of adopting an inclusive problem-solving approach, which we believe may be better suited to offering solutions to the various global problems that have been identified or that are still emerging. We believe that such an approach addresses and expands the individual, social, economic and political features of education and conduces to the improvement and expansion of learning and life chances. © 2013 Copyright 2013 Society for Educational Studies.",education; global; inclusive problem solving; learning; life chances; lifelong learning,,,,,,,,,,"Chapman, J.

It is therefore important to create and nurture mature behaviour in younger generations towards the environment. Such behaviour is vital to ensure that the environment is continually protected and conserved. Exploring the levels of knowledge, attitudes and environment-friendly practice in young civil servants is an initial step in designing an environmental programme that will empower youth in leading and promoting recycling as one environment-friendly response to a threatened environment. To achieve this purpose, this study utilised the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) Model to examine the levels of knowledge, attitudes and workplace recycling practice among young civil servants. The study involved 244 young civil servants randomly selected from administration or management divisions in 25 government agencies aged between 20 and 40 years. The findings reveal that the level of knowledge and attitudes among the young civil servants on recycling was remarkable. However, the level of recycling practice at the workplace is moderate. Both recycling knowledge and attitudes are predictors of workplace recycling practice among young civil servants. Thus, any intervention programme involving youth to improve recycling should consider these results as a basis in designing a programme that can equip youth with some abilities and skills in proper recycling methods. With this knowledge, they can inspire their colleagues to actively participate in office recycling practices. In addition, these well-trained young civil servants can also be appointed to become change agents in promoting, educating and enhancing recycling practices in their neighbourhood. Civil servants not only serve the people, but can also lead in voluntary community environment-friendly activities. Indeed, they should be encouraged to do so. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.",Change agent; Empowerment programme; Environment-friendly practice; KAP Model; Recycling attitudes; Recycling knowledge; Recycling practice,,,,,,,,,,"Besar, T.A.; Communication Department, Faculty of Modern Languages and Communication, Universiti Putra MalaysiaMalaysia",,,Universiti Putra Malaysia,,,,,1287702,,,,English,Pertanika J.

This fact underlines the significance that is assigned to education in the context of sustainable development. It leads to the question of what competencies teachers need in order to develop and implement educational offers in the field of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) so that they can aspire to and attain specific educational goals with their students. This touches on the question of the building of corresponding competencies in teacher education and further education. So far, few attempts have been made to describe teachers' competencies regarding ESD and to develop corresponding competence models. The following article presents two models-Curriculum, Sustainable Development, Competences, Teacher Training (CSCT Model) and Learning for the future: The Competences in Education for Sustainable Development (ECE Model)-and discusses their benefit for teacher education and further education. These models differ in how broadly they define ESD and in what audiences they target at. This comparison shows and explains why competence models should focus on profession-specific core competencies if they are to be used as a basis for the conception of educational offers in the field of ESD in education and further education of teachers. The drawn conclusion consists in initial considerations for the conception of another competence model. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Csct-model; Ece-model; Education for Sustainable Development; Teacher competencies,curriculum; environmental education; numerical model; sustainable development; teacher training,,,,,,,,,"Künzli, C.; School for Teacher Education, Institute for Pre-Primary and Early Primary Education, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, FHNW, Obere Sternengasse 7, Solothurn-SO 4502, Switzerland; email: christine.kuenzli@fhnw.ch",,,MDPI AG,,,,,20711050,,,,English,Sustainability,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894026649

A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a ""climate-smart food system"" that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.",,carbon dioxide; drinking water; fossil fuel; methane; surface water; climate change; crop production; drinking water; food availability; food security; health risk; vulnerability; agricultural land; biomass production; burn; caloric intake; cassava; chronic disease; climate change; contamination; crop improvement; crop production; decision making; developing country; ecology; economic development; energy consumption; food availability; food insecurity; food security; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; harvest; health survey; household; human; human activities; land use; livestock; malnutrition; mental capacity; nutritional deficiency; nutritional status; obesity; physical activity; plant growth; plant physiology; political system; population growth; priority journal; review; sanitation; sea level rise; sociology; South Asia; sugarcane; systematic error; systematic review; tropics; underweight; United Nations,,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8",,,,,,,"Wheeler, T.; Walker Institute for Climate System Research, Department of Agriculture, University of Reading, Reading RG6 6AR, United Kingdom; email: t.r.wheeler@reading.ac.uk",,,American Association for the Advancement of Science,,,,,368075,,SCIEA,,English,Science,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881061285

Different tools and assessment exercises have looked at course descriptors; however, the influence of the number of students enrolled on courses, or the relative weight in credits of the courses in respect of the degrees, has not been explored. The paper compares, with the help of t-tests, three hypotheses developed to investigate the effect of these two influences. The analysis was done using the results from an updated version of the Sustainability Tool for Assessing UNiversities' Curricula Holistically (STAUNCH®) for the Bachelor and Master programmes from the Faculty of Business and the Faculty of Environment of the University of Leeds. The analysis shows that the results are not statistically dissimilar. Nonetheless, the curricula assessment (including the number of students enrolled and the number of credits) can help to better understand where the university's courses and programmes are, and how they could be changed to become more sustainability oriented, and, ultimately, to have the greatest impact to help make societies more sustainable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Student's conceptions on global warming were collected in a reanalysis of 24 studies on everyday concepts of global warming as well as in an own interview study with 35 18-year-old students from German grammar schools. Climate-scientists conceptions were analysed from textbooks and research reports in a literature study. All data were analysed by systematic metaphor analysis and qualitative content analysis. Experientialism as a theory of metaphor provided insight in the process of understanding. The analysis of conceptions by experientialism shows that students and scientists have different metaphorical conceptions of global warming - but both refer to the same schemata. These schemata in mind we categorised the conceptions of global warming. Hereby we identified different thinking patterns in students' and scientists' conceptions. Following the model of educational reconstruction we took the metaphorical conceptions as a starting point for the development of learning environments.

This change in ESE practice implies a relocation of the process of environmental knowledge constitution from 'before' to 'in' the educational event. The aim of this paper is to clarify both the processes of knowledge constitution and the content of the constituted knowledge within participatory ESE practices. Two methods based on John Dewey's transactional perspective are used in the study: epistemological move analysis and pragmatic discourse analysis. The empirical material consists of video-recorded student discussions about climate change in the setting of a Swedish upper secondary school with a pronounced sustainability approach. In the analyses, six different epistemological moves used by the students are identified. The analyses show how students cooperatively constitute a specific view of climate change by using these moves. A main conclusion of this study is that participatory approaches do not necessarily mean that knowledge becomes more diverse. It is therefore important that teachers pay attention to governing processes among students and occasionally challenge the common view in order to allow for alternative possibilities and views. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",classroom interaction; climate change; epistemological moves; participatory approach; video-recording,,,,,,"Vetenskapsrådet, VR","The empirical material consists of video-recorded student discussions about climate change in the setting of a Swedish upper secondary school with a pronounced sustainability profile, where a participatory approach signifies the teaching.

The development of a two-tier diagnostic test procedure as described by Treagust constitutes the framework for this study. To differentiate a lack of knowledge from a misconception, a certainty response index is added as a third tier to each item. Based on propositional knowledge statements, related literature, and the identified misconceptions gathered initially from 157 pre-service teachers, the AREPDiT was constructed and administered to 256 pre-service teachers. The Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of the pre-service teachers' scores was estimated to be 0.74. Content and face validations were established by senior experts. A moderate positive correlation between the participants' both-tiers scores and their certainty scores indicated evidence for construct validity. Therefore, the AREPDiT is a reliable and valid instrument not only to identify pre-service teachers' misconceptions about GW, GE, OLD, and AR but also to differentiate these misconceptions from lack of knowledge.

Service delivery, policy making and policy processes are being carried out by new actors and organisations with new interests, methods and discourses, related to the emergence of new forms of governance. This timely book from bestselling author Stephen Ball and Carolina Junemann uses network analysis and interviews with key actors to address these changes, with a particular focus on education and the increasingly important role of new philanthropy. Critically engaging with the burgeoning literature on new governance, they present a new method for researching governance - network ethnography- which allows identification of the increasing influence of finance capital and education businesses in policy and public service delivery. In a highly original and very topical analysis of the practical workings of the Third Way and the Big Society, the book will be useful to practicing social and education policy analysts and theorists and ideal supplementary reading for students and researchers of social and education policy. © The Policy Press 2012.

Teachers need to understand the natural and human-induced factors affecting climate, and the potential consequences, and ways to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This study focusses on assessing preservice and inservice teachers' knowledge about climate change at the beginning and end of an instructional intervention embedded in an elementary science methods course. This paper describes the development of an instrument derived from the constructive modeling approach framework. The four components of this approach (the construct map, items design, outcome space, and measurement model) are discussed.

Environmental education faces the challenge of developing instructional settings that foster students conceptual understanding concept of the greenhouse effect in order to understand global warming. To facilitate students conceptual development with regard to the greenhouse effect, learning materials aimed at promoting active cognitive learning in order to achieve deep understanding were designed. The learning materials were developed on the basis of the theory of reasoning and understanding co-founded by the Swiss educational psychologist Aebli. In a repeated measure design using a pre-, post- and follow-up test, the efficacy of these learning materials compared with standard learning materials was tested. A total of 289 eighth graders who had received little prior science instruction participated in the study. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to examine the students knowledge acquisition and understanding over three measurement times. The group that had been instructed according to the method aimed at in-depth learning outperformed the group taught with standard materials on subsequent tests in terms of knowledge gains, structure and retention. The findings suggest that the theory-based learning materials promote active cognitive processing during learning. The instructional design of the learning materials seems to engage the learners in high cognitive activities that facilitate deep conceptual understanding of the complex and abstract concept of the greenhouse effect. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",active cognitive learning; conceptual development; greenhouse effect; in-depth learning; mental model building,cognition; conceptual framework; educational development; environmental education; global warming; greenhouse effect; learning; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; student,,,,,,"We would like to thank the participating schools, teachers and their students.

It focuses on one particular object (a mini-warehouse) and one policy (Productivity Places Program) and develops an approach to researching a topology of policy enactment along three intersecting axes. In this topology, the material is given an ontological status, which is 'in-here' as opposed to 'else-where'; where reality is emergent in practice. The research focus therefore is on policy processes and the assumption is that these processes are not benign as the world continues to be (re)articulated unequally; the point of policy research being to investigate the ways in which policy processes contribute to or work against this inequality. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",discourse; emergence; enactment; materiality; policy; practice,,,,,,,,,,"Heimans, S.; School of Education, Australia; email: s.heimans@uq.edu.au",,,,,,,,1596306,,,,English,Discourse,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859584701

In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Biodiversity; Climate change; Species extinctions,"biodiversity; biome; climate change; climate effect; extinction risk; future prospect; habitat loss; temporal period; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; population dynamics; theoretical model; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Models, Theoretical; Population Dynamics",,,,,,,,,"Courchamp, F.; Ecologie, Systématique and Evolution, , Orsay Cedex 91405, France; email: franck.courchamp@u-psud.fr",,,,,,,,1461023X,,ECLEF,22257223,English,Ecol.

Students tend to cite short-term weather effects as evidence to support or refute long-term climate transformations, which displays a fundamental misunderstanding about weather and climate distinctions. Confusion about weather and climate may also reflect student misunderstanding about deep time, a concept that spans several scientific content areas. This study examines the relationships between students' understanding of deep time and their understandings of the distinctions between weather and climate, as well as how these understandings influence students' perceptions about the plausibility of human-induced global climate change. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory science class on global climate change completed measures of their (a) understanding of distinctions between weather and climate, (b) knowledge of deep time, and (c) plausibility perceptions of human-induced climate change, both at the beginning and end of the course. The study includes comparison groups of similar students enrolled in introductory physical geography classes. Results revealed that greater knowledge of deep time and increased plausibility perceptions of human-induced climate change provide significant explanation of variance in students' understanding of weather and climate distinctions. Furthermore, students achieve significantly increased understanding of weather and climate, even with brief instruction. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Climate change; Conceptual change; Misconceptions; Plausibility; Weather and climate distinctions,,,,,,,,,,"Lombardi, D.; University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Box 453003, Las Vegas, NV 89154-3003, United States; email: lombar37@unlv.nevada.edu",,,,,,,,0157244X,,,,English,Res.

During the last years, many universities have undertaken activities for implementing Higher Education for Sustainable Development (HESD). Many have asked which key competencies are most relevant for sustainable development and hence should be developed in future-oriented higher education. Different approaches for the selection of sustainability key competencies have been developed, but there is little international agreement in the debate around the most important key competencies. Consequently, this paper asks which individual key competencies are crucial for understanding central challenges facing the world society and for facilitating its development towards a more sustainable future, and thus identifies those competencies which should be fostered through university teaching and learning. The empirical design of the study is related to a Delphi study in which 'sustainability key competencies' are defined by selected experts from Europe (Germany, Great Britain) and Latin America (Chile, Ecuador, Mexico). The results show that twelve key competencies crucial for sustainable development can be identified; the most relevant ones are those for systemic thinking, anticipatory thinking and critical thinking. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Delphi study; Europe; Future of higher education; Higher Education for Sustainable Development; Key competencies; Latin America,empirical analysis; higher education; learning; sustainable development; teaching; university sector; Europe; Latin America,,,,,Heinrich Böll Stiftung,The study was carried out as part of a doctoral thesis and was made possible by a doctoral scholarship from the Heinrich Böll Foundation.,,,"Rieckmann, M.; Institute for Environmental and Sustainability Communication, Scharnhorststr. 1, D-21335 Lüneburg, Germany; email: rieckmann@uni.leuphana.de",,,,,,,,163287,,,,English,Futures,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856221251

The instrument was administered to students in Grades 6 to 12 (N = 1532) from 12 schools in the Sultanate of Oman. The findings indicated that the majority of Omani students believe that global warming is happening now, and are concerned about it. Students are willing to undertake some actions, such as switching off unused domestic appliances, more than others, such as using public transport, despite the fact that they believe the latter would reduce global warming. Novel indices were constructed to explore the relationship between belief and willingness to act for specific actions. The findings suggest that the link between belief and willingness to act is stronger for some actions, such as increasing recycling, than others, such as using smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.

The main objectives of this study were to bring changes to students’ behaviour and attitudes to protect and conserve local drinking water resources. In order to address local water quality issues, students were provided with the scientific skills to monitor water quality, essential water quality parameters to protect against/prevent water pollution and were motivated and trained to practise various climatic change adaptations in order to conserve their local water resources and to create awareness among the local community about climatic change adaptations and the protection/conservation of local water resources through service-learning education. In this study, a pre- and post-test with control group design was used to measure students’ efficiency of knowledge, attitude, and behaviour pre- and post-test. Activity-based environmental education methods were used to address water quality issues and climate change at local level, including classroom sessions such as lectures, PowerPoint presentations, films on various water issues and climate change, debates, essay/painting competitions, and quizzes and tests. During the outdoor activities, students were facilitated with hands-on activities, field trips, community visits, games and group projects. The post-test results revealed that there was an increase in students’ knowledge, understanding, attitudes and skills to solve local water resources and climate change problems. This study therefore stresses the need to extend teaching and learning activities into the immediate environment of the pupils beyond the classroom so that they are made aware of and understand water resources and climate change studies. © 2012, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Active participation; Attitude and knowledge; Climate change; Environmental education; Local natural resources; Water resources,,,,,,,"Acknowledgments The author would like to thank the Department of Education and Policy Perspectives (DERPP) and NCERT, New Delhi, India for their financial assistance for this study.",,,,,,Springer,,,,,16102002,,,,English,Climate Change Manag.,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056142244

In response to this, a great deal of attention has been given to evaluating ‘how well’ policies are realised in practice – implemented! Less attention has been paid to understanding how schools actually deal with these multiple, and sometimes contradictory, policy demands; creatively working to interpret policy texts and translate these into practices, in real material conditions and varying resources – how they are enacted! Based on a long-term qualitative study of four ‘ordinary’ secondary schools, and working on the interface of theory with data, this book explores how schools enact, rather than implement, policy. It focuses on◦ contexts of ‘policy work’ in schools◦ teachers as policy subjects◦ teachers as policy actors◦ policy texts, artefacts and events◦ standards, behaviour and learning policies.This book offers an original and very grounded analysis of how schools and teachers do policy. It will be of interest to undergraduate and postgraduate students of education, education policy and social policy, as well as school leaders, in the UK and beyond. © 2012 Stephen J.

While plural perspectives on ESD are encouraged both by practitioners and researchers of EE, there is also a danger that such pluralism may sustain dominant political ideologies and consolidated corporate power that obscure environmental concerns. Encouraging plural interpretations of ESD may in fact lead ecologically ill-informed teachers and students acculturated by the dominant neo-liberal ideology to underprivilege ecocentric perspective. It is argued that ESD, with its focus on human welfare, equality, rights and fair distribution of resources is a radical departure from the aim of EE set out by the Belgrade Charter as well as a distinct turn towards anthropocentrically biased education. This article has two aims: to demonstrate the importance of environmental ethics for EE in general and ESD in particular and to argue in favour of a return to instrumentalism, based on the twinned assumptions that the environmental problems are severe and that education of ecologically minded students could help their resolution. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",anthropocentrism; ecological justice; education for sustainable development (ESD); environmental education (EE); environmental ethics; sustainable development (SD),,,,,,,,,,"Kopnina, H.; Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Labour Studies, , Amsterdam, Netherlands; email: h.kopnina@hhs.nl",,,Routledge,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

Pre, post, and follow-up surveys were used to determine the differences in knowledge gained and retained by students that received direct instruction from their science teacher, and by those who received equivalent content instruction from outside presenters. The teacher participant also completed a survey on her experience with the researcher-designed lesson plans. Students' results on the surveys were compared to results from a control group with no intervention. The teacher-based setting resulted in significantly higher knowledge gain, although no difference was found between the groups' rate of knowledge decline thereafter. Highest gains in knowledge were for the carbon cycle and the human impacts topic, followed by understanding the difference between climate and weather. The students and teacher alike appeared to struggle with the topic of global warming and the greenhouse effect. The research suggests that with the appropriate background information the classroom teacher is likely to be more effective at conveying the science of climate change, particularly when it is taught through an understanding of the carbon cycle and its human impacts. It also suggests that those non-governmental organizations engaged in climate change education might be better served by investing their limited resources in the development of learning materials and subsequent professional development for teachers rather than focusing on in-school presentations. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",climate; environmental education; global warming; greenhouse effect; knowledge retention; middle school curriculum; science instruction,,,,,,,,,,"Weaver, A.

As a result of the research, some studies which didn't complement one another both in the world and in Turkey were encountered. However, for the most part the studies conducted had similar purposes and they had the same results. Descriptive studies introduced that similar misconceptions related to global warming existed in all levels of education and the media had negative effects during this process. Experimental studies revealed that the education methods where the students are active, visual materials and social activities outside the school were more effective methods in educating more conscious students about global warming. © 2011 Eḡitim Dani{dotless}şmanli{dotless}ḡi{dotless} ve Araşti{dotless}rmalari{dotless} İletişim Hizmetleri Tic.

This paper scrutinises the development of sustainable campus in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia by diagnosing the domains of Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) of this development based on the results of a field survey involving 191 students and 45 staff. Result analyses found the following: (1) Knowledge divergence between the staff and students with regard to UKM being on the path of a sustainable campus, but a convergence of opinions with regard to the introduction of sustainable campus programmes, the adoption of sustainable lifestyle and the preparation towards it despite potential inconvenience, the desirability for sustainability being practiced by the higher UKM administration, and the adoption of a merit and demerit system to boost the acculturation of sustainability in UKM; (2) The existence of a dichotomy between attitudes and practices exemplified by preference for private over public transport in spite of wanting a sustainable campus and the practice of 4R (refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle) by staff only. The implication of the findings is the imperative of alignment in the domains of Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices for staff and students in the building of a sustainable campus to minimise dichotomies and divergence in the KAP domains but also and to provide for effective sustainability benchmarks not only for UKM but also other campuses pursuing sustainability. © IDOSI Publications. 2011.",Attitudes; Capacity building; Knowledge; Practices; Sustainable campus,,,,,,,,,,"Er, A.

This study evaluates the course's impact on students' learning of climate change and human interaction and improvement of information literacy in science based on students' responses to several questionnaires and interview data collected through the academic year of 2009. Results show that even if individual students had a different level of background knowledge of climate change and human interactions before the course, their content knowledge improved through the course. The students agreed that the course positively affected their information literacy in science (climate change) and interest. However, they neither disagreed nor agreed that they learned science knowledge relevant to their everyday lives and current socioeconomic issues related to climate change.

Our central question is whether social and technical innovations can reverse the trends that are challenging critical thresholds and creating tipping points in the earth system, and if not, what conditions are necessary to escape the current lock-in. Large-scale transformations in information technology, nano- and biotechnology, and new energy systems have the potential to significantly improve our lives; but if, in framing them, our globalized society fails to consider the capacity of the biosphere, there is a risk that unsustainable development pathways may be reinforced. Current institutional arrangements, including the lack of incentives for the private sector to innovate for sustainability, and the lags inherent in the path dependent nature of innovation, contribute to lock-in, as does our incapacity to easily grasp the interactions implicit in complex problems, referred to here as the ingenuity gap. Nonetheless, promising social and technical innovations with potential to change unsustainable trajectories need to be nurtured and connected to broad institutional resources and responses. In parallel, institutional entrepreneurs can work to reduce the resilience of dominant institutional systems and position viable shadow alternatives and niche regimes. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2011.",Innovation; Resilience transitions; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability; Transformation,biosphere; biotechnology; environmental economics; global perspective; incentive; information technology; innovation; institutional framework; nanotechnology; nature-society relations; risk assessment; sustainability; threshold; trend analysis; biotechnology; conference paper; environmental protection; information service; nanotechnology; Biotechnology; Conservation of Natural Resources; Information Services; Nanotechnology,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 266723",,,,"Westley, F.; Social Innovation Generation, 195 King Street West, Kitchener, ON N2G 1B1, Canada; email: fwestley@uwaterloo.ca",,,,,,,,447447,,AMBOC,22338714,English,Ambio,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-80155184870

The study evaluates the views of twenty experienced German chemistry teachers about the teaching of climate change in chemistry education. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews about the teachers' experiences and their views about desirable teaching practices. The interviews were conducted and evaluated by advanced chemistry student teachers in the framework of a university seminar. Analysis was done with an eye towards teachers' overall ideas concerning where this topic should come in the curriculum, the potential amount of time allocated to it, and the content of lessons connected to climate change within chemistry education. The results show a variety of different points of view. Although all the teachers emphasized, more or less, the importance of students' learning about climate change, they also documented a lack of consensus about the place within the chemistry curriculum for the impact of climate change. There is no consensus on whether to teach about the chemistry of climate change starting in early lower secondary education, or to postpone the issue completely until the upper secondary chemistry education. As there is no agreement about the place in the curriculum there is no agreement either about the different roles the single school subjects should play, or the amount of time to be dedicated to the issue of climate change. Concerning the suggested amount of time, the practices reported range from single periods on different aspects of climate change from time to time to individual teachers considering the issue to be so important as to teach whole self-contained units on the subject. Overall, it seems that for the majority of the teachers the great emphasis on learning about climate change mentioned by them, does not result in making climate change a prominent issue in its own right within the chemistry curriculum. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.",Chemistry teachers' beliefs; Climate change; Pedagogic content knowledge (PCK); Research-oriented learning; Teacher education,,,,,,,,,,"Eilks, I.; University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany; email: ingo.eilks@uni-bremen.de",,,,,,,,11094028,,,,English,Chem.

However, the strong scientific consensus on the detection, attribution, and risks of climate change stands in stark contrast to widespread confusion, complacency and denial among policymakers and the public. Risk communication is now a major bottleneck preventing science from playing an appropriate role in climate policy. Here I argue that the ability of the IPCC to fulfill its mission can be enhanced through better understanding of the mental models of the audiences it seeks to reach, then altering the presentation and communication of results accordingly. Few policymakers are trained in science, and public understanding of basic facts about climate change is poor. But the problem is deeper. Our mental models lead to persistent errors and biases in complex dynamic systems like the climate and economy. Where the consequences of our actions spill out across space and time, our mental models have narrow boundaries and focus on the short term. Where the dynamics of complex systems are conditioned by multiple feedbacks, time delays, accumulations and nonlinearities, we have difficulty recognizing and understanding feedback processes, underestimate time delays, and do not understand basic principles of accumulation or how nonlinearities can create regime shifts. These problems arise not only among laypeople but also among highly educated elites with significant training in science. They arise not only in complex systems like the climate but also in familiar contexts such as filling a bathtub. Therefore they cannot be remedied merely by providing more information about the climate, but require different modes of communication, including experiential learning environments such as interactive simulations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,Basic principles; Climate change risks; Climate policy; Complex dynamic systems; Different modes; Experiential learning; Feedback process; Interactive simulations; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Mental model; Multiple feedback; Policy makers; Public understanding; Regime shift; Risk communication; Short term; Space and time; Climate models; Communication; Feedback; Public risks; Risk assessment; Time delay; User interfaces; Climate change; climate change; environmental policy; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; learning; nonlinearity; policy making; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis,,,,,,,,,"Sterman, J.

We draw theoretical and analytical guidance from the identity-protective cognition thesis explaining the white male effect and from recent political psychology scholarship documenting the heightened system-justification tendencies of political conservatives. We utilize public opinion data from ten Gallup surveys from 2001 to 2010, focusing specifically on five indicators of climate change denial. We find that conservative white males are significantly more likely than are other Americans to endorse denialist views on all five items, and that these differences are even greater for those conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming very well. Furthermore, the results of our multivariate logistic regression models reveal that the conservative white male effect remains significant when controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender as well as the effects of nine control variables. We thus conclude that the unique views of conservative white males contribute significantly to the high level of climate change denial in the United States. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Climate change denial; Gender; Political ideology; Public opinion; Race,attitudinal survey; climate change; cognition; gender role; global warming; male behavior; multivariate analysis; political ideology; psychology; public attitude; racial identity; regression analysis; United States,,,,,,,,,"McCright, A.M.; Lyman Briggs College, E-185 Holmes Hall, East Lansing, MI 48825-1107, United States; email: mccright@msu.edu",,,,,,,,9593780,,GECHE,,English,Global Environ.

Equipped with a limited mental model they inappropriately use a pattern matching heuristics to analyze climate change and mistakenly believe that we can stabilize atmospheric CO2 by keeping anthropogenic emissions at current rates. Drawing on the findings from cognitive and developmental psychology, I argue that the widespread misunderstanding of climate change may arise from an error in people's ontological assumptions. The pattern matching heuristics highlights correlations in shape and associates with a static mental model, both of which are effective for understanding objects. When people adopt the pattern matching heuristics, they may have implicitly treated climate change as an object. However, climate change belongs to a different kind of ontological existence. It is a dynamic process with temporal totality and inertia, two unique features essential to understanding climate change. Due to the sequence of cognitive development, we have developed an object bias - a tendency to treat processes as objects. This object bias can become a mental block, preventing us from adopting appropriate mental models to analyze climate change. To understand climate change, we need a fundamental transformation from an object-only ontology to a new one that properly treats objects and processes as distinct kinds. Finally, I briefly discuss strategies to foster the new ontological perspective in the discussion of climate change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric CO; Cognitive development; Current rate; Developmental psychology; Dynamic process; Mental blocks; Mental model; Unique features; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Ontology; Pattern matching; Climate change; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; climate change; cognition; emission inventory; heuristics; perception; psychology,,,,,,,,,"Chen, X.; Department of Philosophy, 60 W Olsen Rd., Thousand Oaks, CA 91360, United States; email: chenxi@clunet.edu",,,,,,,,1650009,,CLCHD,,English,Clim.

In this paper, we suggest that neoliberalism has remained dominant in part because the power elite who benefit from the policies have gained control over both public debate and policy-making. By dominating the discourse and logic regarding economic, environmental, and education decision-making, neoliberal proponents have largely succeeded in marginalizing alternative conceptions. We then use critical theory and critical geography, or 'historical geographic materialism', to situate communities, cities, and countries within different scales and networks and analyse current neoliberal policies. Environmentally, neoliberalism elevates the market and profit above considerations of climate change and environmental sustainability. Educationally, learning is valued primarily in terms of its contribution to economic growth. Finally, we engage in the more complicated question of what kind of world we want to live in, remembering that rather than a self-perpetuating neoliberalism in which individuals are responsible only for themselves and all decisions are supposedly made by the market, we have responsibility for our relationships with one another and our built and natural environment. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Critical geography; Democracy; Environmental sustainability; Neoliberalism,,,,,,,,,,"Hursh, D.

References to engaging users in and with research are now common in research funding requirements, national research strategies and large-scale research programmes. User engagement has therefore become part of the rhetoric of educational and social science research. But what is user engagement, how can it be achieved and what challenges and opportunities does it present for researchers and research users?The authors of this new book present an authoritative overview of recent theoretical debates, practical developments and empirical evidence on the role of user engagement in contemporary educational and social science research. The book focuses on the relationship between user engagement and research design, and emphasises how user engagement needs to be understood as an interplay between the different kinds of knowledge and expertise held by researchers and users. Drawing on evidence from studies involving different kinds of research users, there is detailed discussion of the dynamics and complexities of working with practitioners, service users and policy-makers. The authors make clear that user engagement has definite implications for the way in which research is designed, managed and commissioned, and the way in which researchers and research users are trained, supported and encouraged to interact.Written for the many professionals involved in funding, doing and using research within education and other social sciences, this book provides:• conceptual guidance on different approaches and interpretations of user engagement• examples and evidence of effective strategies for engaging practitioners, service users and policy-makers• capacity building ideas and implications for researchers and research users• specific suggestions as to how the conceptualization, management, scaling up and evidence base of user engagement could be improved.At the core of this forward-thinking text is a robust analysis of an important facet of modern social science research. The authors’ evidence-based, evaluative approach provides a useful, detailed analysis of an area of social science research methodology which is increasingly valued and emphasised by research councils and mediators. © 2011 Mark Rickinson, Judy Sebba and Anne Edwards.",,,,,,,,,,,"Rickinson, M.; Department of Education, University of OxfordUnited Kingdom",,,Taylor and Francis,,,,,,9.78E+12,,,English,Improving Research through User Engagem.,Book,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909436834

However 'sustainability' is unconvincingly represented in the curriculum and is not visible in the standards. This could potentially result in its omission from teacher education and qualification at all levels. A similar situation already exists in New South Wales (NSW). This article illustrates the positioning of five freshly graduated primary teachers within the context of their five NSW schools and from this distils implications for teaching 'sustainability' within the developing national proposals.

A survey revealed that users of the social networking application reported above average knowledge of climate change science and that self-reported environmental behaviors increased during young people's involvement with the Facebook application.

As the curriculum does not often mention the term sustainability, a key with which to investigate signs of education for sustainable development in the three curricula was created. The key encourages a holistic view of sustainable development, where economic, environmental and social factors are not treated as separate entities. It was designed to reflect the goals of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014) with research on environmental education and education for sustainable development in mind. The key has seven characteristics: values, opinions and emotions about nature and environment; knowledge contributing to a sensible use of nature; welfare and public health; democracy, participation, and action competence; equality and multicultural issues; global awareness; and finally, economic development and future prospects. Using the key, a variety of signs and indicators that provide a space for teachers and schools to deal with issues of sustainable development were identified. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Curriculum; Curriculum analysis; Education for sustainable development; Environmental education; Reorientation of education,,,,,,"Háskóli Íslands, HI

These key competencies may be most fully developed in new teaching and learning situations. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the kind of, and extent to which, these key competencies can be acquired in realworld learning opportunities. Design/methodology/approach – The paper summarizes key competencies in sustainability, identifies criteria for realworld learning opportunities in sustainability programs, and draws on dominant realworld learning models including project and problembased learning, service learning, and internships in communities, businesses, and governments. These components are integrated into a framework to design realworld learning opportunities. Findings – A “functional and progressive” model of realworld learning opportunities seems most conducive to introduce students (as well as faculty and community partners) to collaborative research between academic researchers and practitioners. The stepwise process combined with additional principles allows building competencies such as problem solving, linking knowledge to action, and collaborative work, while applying concepts and methods from the field of sustainability. Practical implications – The paper offers examples of realworld learning opportunities at the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University, discusses general challenges of implementation and organizational learning, and draws attention to critical success factors such as collaborative design, coordination, and integration in general introductory courses for undergraduate students. Originality/value – The paper contributes to sustainability education by clarifying how realworld learning opportunities contribute to the acquisition of key competencies in sustainability. It proposes a functional and progressive model to be integrated into the (undergraduate) curriculum and suggests strategies for its implementation. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Competences; Curricula; Experiential learning; Higher education; Problem solving; Sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14676370,,,,English,Int.

In relation to ETF it points out that no major emphasis has been put to date on combining economic, social and environmental considerations. It then analyses the ways economies operate in relation to sustainable development and the changed knowledge and skills needed for both economies and for a sustainable future. Implications for VET reform include attending to the broad goals of inclusion and equity, a reconsideration of the competences to be developed and the didactic approaches within a framework of lifelong learning. The didactics proposed are in line with current thinking related to constructivist pedagogy, an inter-disciplinary approach to 'real life' problems and increasing the porosity of school boundaries to the community.

Today, the capacities that underlie economic competitiveness must also be brought to bear on policy and pedagogy to prepare the coming generation to face an unprecedented and dangerous global future. This article argues that the bureaucratic 'industrial', standards-driven model of schooling currently fails to release the talents of students either for the competitiveness or collaboration that will be crucial in facing the demands of the decades ahead. It argues for policies, schools and pedagogies that promote creativity and a human capacity for innovation, not the relentless pursuit of externally imposed measurable standards. The types of necessary learning experiences are explored and examples are provided of principles and practices that teachers and schools need to develop further. Education for economic competitiveness on one hand and education for sustainable development on the other both require similar open minds, creative skills and teaching methods to prepare students for the transformations and innovations ahead. In answering the question 'what do competitiveness and sustainable development require from schools and teachers?' we conclude that most elements of appropriate pedagogies are available but they need to be extended. Managing their extension on a large scale to transform complex education systems is a major challenge for policy-makers and educators at all levels. © 2010 The Authors.

Using a multi-level assessment design, student content knowledge gains were measured before and after implementation of a three-week unit on global warming (a prominent SSI) that explored both the relevant science content and the controversy surrounding global warming. Measures of student content knowledge were made using a standards-aligned content knowledge exam (distal assessment) and a curriculum-aligned exam (proximal assessment). Data were collected from 108 students enrolled from two schools. Quantitative analysis of the distal assessment indicated that student post-test scores were statistically significantly different than their pre-test scores (F = 15.31, p<0.001). Qualitative analyses of student responses from the proximal assessment indicated that students, on average, expressed more accurate, more detailed, and more sophisticated understandings of global warming, the greenhouse effect, and the controversy and challenges associated with these issues following the three-week unit. Combined results from the proximal and distal assessments explored in this study offer important evidence in supporting the efficacy of using SSI as contexts for science education. In addition to a discussion of the components of an SSI-based curriculum, this study provides support for the use of SSI as a context for learning science content. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Assessment; Chemistry education; Curriculum; Environmental education; Socioscientific issues,,,,,,,,,,"Klosterman, M.

Our research focuses on the discourse in urban high school science classrooms in which the teachers used the same global climate change curriculum. We analyzed transcripts from three teachers' classrooms examining both the argument structure as well the dialogic interactions between students. Between 19% and 35% of the discourse focused on scientific argumentation in that students were using evidence and reasoning to justify their claims. Yet in terms of dialogic interactions, only one teacher's classroom was characterized by student-to-student interactions and students explicitly supporting or refuting the ideas presented by their peers. This teacher's use of open questions appeared to encourage students to construct and justify their claims using both their scientific and everyday knowledge. Furthermore, her explicit connections to previous students' comments appeared to encourage students to consider multiple views, reflect on their thinking and reflect on the thinking of their classmates. This study suggests that a teacher's use of open-ended questions may play a key role in supporting students in argumentation in terms of both providing evidence and reasoning for students' claims and encouraging dialogic interactions between students. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,"McNeill, K.L.; Lynch School of Education, , Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, United States; email: kmcneill@bc.edu",,,,,,,,368326,,,,English,Sci.

It argues that such an integrative view is required in the context of the urgency of building more resilient local social-ecological systems (SES), and that such a view offers the possibility of new energy and direction in the sustainability education debate. The paper is essentially a think piece that attempts to look at touchstones between discourses to suggest the possibilities and potential of mutual illumination and better integration. The paper begins by reviewing tensions between an instrumentalist view and an intrinsic value view of environmental and sustainability education, the former seeing such education as a means to individual and social change, the latter upholding the primacy of the autonomous learner who, secondarily may- or may not- take action towards sustainability. The paper then considers the discourse of the resilient learner, before reviewing social learning literature linked to resilience and discussing how far these various views can be brought together and reconciled. Parallels are made with tensions in the debate on sustainability when seen as a desirable ideal, or as a process. Transformative learning theory is then introduced in relation to addressing the paradox of resilient but maladaptive worldviews and the need to educate for resilience. The paper concludes with an argument for a transformative education paradigm- 'sustainable education'- which necessarily integrates instrumental and intrinsic views and which nurtures resilient learners able to develop resilient social-ecological systems in the face of a future of threat, uncertainty and surprise. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Environmental education; Resilience; Sustainability; Sustainable education,,,,,,,,,,"Sterling, S.; Centre for Sustainable Futures, , Devon, United Kingdom; email: stephen.sterling@plymouth.ac.uk",,,Routledge,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

Our main focus is on work in primary and lower secondary schools as part of a search for trends of international interest related to the conceptualization and practice of environmental education and ESD in both countries, as well as the role and significance of democratic perspectives to their development. Traditionally, Sweden has a more centralised approach to change compared to a more decentralised approach in Denmark. Accordingly, the interplay between the State, the individual and private initiatives has differed over the past half-century, and this has given rise to interesting effects on the development of environmental education as well as ESD. The discussion of their development in Sweden draws on historical, political and organisational perspectives, while for Denmark, we focus on how these perspectives relate to a series of challenges; for example, the epistemological challenge of the development of environmental education that resulted in 'the new generation of environmental education', and the effects of taking an action competence approach to environmental education. In both countries the links between the development of environmental education and ESD and the discourse of environmental protection and democracy are highlighted, as are the interplays between the State's agenda on education, the actions of research institutions, and the provision of in-service teacher training. Sweden has become a world leader in initiatives for ESD promotion and joint efforts to spur innovations and clarification of ESD, while Denmark has mainly put its efforts into developing science education, and in this regard, has sacrificed the development of ESD. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Democracy; Education for sustainable development; Esd; General education; New education; School education,,,,,,"Styrelsen för Internationellt Utvecklingssamarbete, Sida

Knowledge and attitudes are essential in the SD process. This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of local people about SD. Aim To study the factors that influence the understanding of the concept, contents, and indicators of different aspects affecting the health and environmental issues. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out from June to July 2007 among 546 households in the Quang Tri province. Data were gathered on basis of socio-demographic variables, namely age, gender, education, occupation, income, and region. Chi square tests and multivariate analysis were performed on the obtained data. The data were cleaned and analysed using SPSS 15.0 for windows. Results Occupation is related to knowledge, attitude, or practice. Income is related to knowledge or practice. Gender related to only attitude. Lastly, region is related to attitude or practice. The proportion of wrong understanding about SD is 2.0 times (95% CI: 1.3; 3.1, p < 0.001) higher than that of the people who have good understanding about it. The rate of willingness to do any related SD programmes of the people who understanding is 2.1 times (95% CI: 1.4; 3.2, p < 0.001) higher than that of the people who have bad one. Conclusions This study shows that knowledge on sustainability of the local communities is low. Occupation and income influence understanding of SD more than region, age, gender, and education. Most of the local people who do not understand SD in general, do not want to participate or act in SD programmes. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Age; Attitude; Education; Gender; Income; Knowledge; Occupation; Practice; Quang Tri; Sustainable development; Vietnam,demography; environmental issue; local participation; multivariate analysis; public attitude; socioeconomic conditions; sustainable development; traditional knowledge; willingness to pay; Quang Tri; Viet Nam,,,,,,,,,"Hens, L.; Human Ecology Department, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium; email: human.ecology@vub.ac.be",,,,,,,,1387585X,,EDSNB,,English,Environ.

In school curricula and educational practice, efforts have been made to include material and issues related to, for example, climate changes and nature resources in teaching and learning. Surprisingly little attention has however been paid to the question of the way (and on what premises) early childhood education might (and should) be involved. In this article we discuss some aspects of early childhood education with a bearing on its role in education for sustainable development. The fact that early childhood education belongs to the larger educational system means that global political and economical issues are involved when planning and conducting education for sustainability in pre-school as much as in the rest of the educational system.

As the objectives, descriptions of the concept of sustainable development are analyzed and classified. Then the analysis of the concept of sustainable development is given. After this analysis the systematic view of the dimensions of sustainable development is provided. Methods of systematic scientific literature analysis, general and logical analysis, comparison and generalization were used for the research. Although the essence of the concept of sustainable development is clear enough, the exact interpretation and definition of sustainable development have caused strong discussions. Thus, we should take into consideration the fact that the concept of sustainable development may be difficult to understand and may have different meaning dependending on the analyzed literature on the concept in which it is used. For this reason, in the article we presented several descriptions of sustainable development that would include multiple aspects of this concept. Difficulties related to the definition of sustainability show that sustainable development is a complex and multidimensional issue, which combines efficiency, equity, and intergenerational equity based on economic, social, and environmental aspects. Debates on sustainable development presented in the literature can be classified into several thematic areas: a) conceptual; b) contextual; c) academic; and d) geopolitical, which are investigated in the article in more details. As a general concept, sustainable development encompasses three fundamental approaches: economic, environmental, and social development, which are interrelated and complementary. Traditionally, the concept of sustainable development involves three equivalent components: environmental, economic, and social development; as well as three dimensions of wellbeing, i.e. economic, ecological, and social, and their complex interrelations, which are investigated in article in more details. We tend to think that the analysis of sustainable development should be based on the assumption, indicating that sustainable development is based not on economic, social, ecological, or institutional dimensions, but rather on their system as an integrated whole. Not all relations identified in a sustainability analysis have the same relevance and the same meaning for the strategic instruments of regional sustainable development. Relations among sub-systems identified should be relocated in a logical structure, based on the intention of the cognitive tool being built. In order to attain this, a hierarchical framework with coherent sustainability logic is needed. Since sustainability issues should be analyzed and solved on the system levels where they develop and manifest themselves, one can consistently formulate respective aims of the sustainable development policy for separate dimensions (economic, ecological, social, and institutional) of sustainable development on each of these levels of economic development policy, thus obtaining the matrix of the aims of sustainability policy.",Dimensions of sustainability; Sustainability policy; Sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,"Ciegis, R.; Vilnius University, Muitines str. 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; email: remigijus.ciegis@aula.vukhf.lt",,,,,,,,13922785,,,,Lithuanian,Engg.

In coping with these challenges, integrated approaches in strategic planning and decision support promise to generate more efficient and effective results than sectoral approaches. In this article, we follow the concept of operational research (OR) by applying a formalized approach to cross-sectoral integrated planning and decision-making in complex, i.e., multi-sectoral systems. The presented Transdisciplinary Integrated Planning and Synthesis (TIPS) approach relies on (soft) OR methods combined in a multi-methodological framework that is adapted to the cognitive skills and habits of the stakeholders and experts involved in mutual and joint learning processes (transdisciplinarity). This methodological contribution structures, formalizes, and empirically illustrates cross-sectoral integrated strategic planning step by step, and evaluates the TIPS methodology against requirements for integrated approaches derived from literature. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It describes an iterative process of designing and analyzing assessment and interview data from students in upper elementary through high school. The product of our development process the learning progression itself is a story about how learners from upper elementary grades through high school develop understanding in an important and complex domain: biogeochemical processes that transform carbon in socio-ecological systems at multiple scales. These processes: (a) generate organic carbon (photosynthesis), (b) transform organic carbon (biosynthesis, digestion, food webs, carbon sequestration), and (c) oxidize organic carbon (cellular respiration, combustion). The primary cause of global climate change is the current worldwide imbalance among these processes. We identified Levels of Achievement, which described patterns in the way students made progress toward more sophisticated reasoning about these processes. Younger learners perceived a world where events occurred at a macroscopic scale and carbon sources, such as foods and fuels, were treated as enablers of life processes and combustion rather than sources of matter transformed by those processes. Students at the transitional levels levels 2 and 3 traced matter in terms of materials changed by hidden mechanisms (level 2) or changed by chemical processes (level 3). More advanced students (level 4) used chemical models to trace matter through hierarchically organized systems that connected organisms and inanimate matter. Although level 4 reasoning is consistent with current national standards, few high school students reasoned this way consistently. We discuss further plans for conceptual and empirical validation of the learning progression. @copy; 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Learning progressions; Student reasoning; Tracing matter,Biogeochemical process; Carbon cycling; Carbon sequestration; Carbon source; Cellular respiration; Chemical model; Chemical process; Complex domains; Development process; Ecological systems; Empirical validation; Food webs; Global climate changes; High school; High school students; Iterative process; Learning progressions; Level 2; Level 4; Life process; Macroscopic scale; Multiple scale; National standard; Student reasoning; Tracing matter; Biochemistry; Climate change; Combustion; Ecology; Photosynthesis; Students; Thermochemistry; Organic carbon,,,,,,,,,"Mohan, L.; Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, United States; email: mohanlin@msu.edu",,,,,,,,224308,,JRSTA,,English,J.

This study followed the development in the knowledge of global warming of 29 primary school students in year 6 (the final year of primary) from two regional Australian schools over one school term. A hands-on science unit dealing specifically with global warming was prepared and taught over a period of eight weeks. A mixed methods approach was adopted and data was gathered through pre- and post-testing, through post intervention interviews. The findings of the study indicated that after the unit, students had a clearer understanding of the science of climate change, with the largest improvement in student knowledge occurring where the students had engaged in hands on activities or had effective visual aids. The data also indicated that an increase in knowledge was accompanied by an increase in levels concern in some cases. However, there was also an overall increase in students' belief about their ability to make a positive impact in relation to global warming and climate change.

A popular and promising approach is the use of systems thinking. However, the systems approach to sustainability has neither been clearly defined nor has its practical application followed any systematic rigor, resulting in confounded and underspecified recommendations. The purpose of this article is to extend the notion of systems thinking as it pertains to sustainability pedagogy. The authors draw from systems theory and other literatures to develop three broad approaches to systems thinking: functionalist, interpretive, and complex adaptive systems (CAS). Each perspective is examined regarding its conceptual underpinnings, implications for sustainability, and pedagogical goals, objectives, skills, and exemplar projects and activities.

The paper also sheds light on whether there is conformity or not in desired sustainability competences (or in how sustainable development (SD) competences are handled) at the three universities. For universities outside the EHEA, this paper gives hints on the type of sustainability competences that will be required from their first-cycle graduates should they want to continue with second-cycle studies within the EHEA. The results show that the three universities follow a similar pattern in the classification of the competences (Knowledge and understanding, Skills and abilities, and Attitudes) and that there are minor divergences with respect to the list of competences and the levels of learning that Bachelor students should have when graduating. Definition of competences is an area that needs development, and this paper is part of a learning process for the three universities.

The lack of educators with a sound technical background in climate science and its applications in agriculture prevents the delivery of courses either stand-alone or embedded in other courses, and adversely affects the ability of graduating students to apply climate information. This paper presents evidence from a professional development climate course with 20 professional educators and consultants and results from: surveys at the training workshop; from a questionnaire 12 months post-workshop; and a combined interview and survey two years post-workshop. The key finding was that professional development courses specifically addressing climate are essential, while topics should include climate and weather, the impacts of climate on agricultural systems, strategic thinking and planning options available for business. A project undertaken by professionals delivering climate education helped to improve their skills and confidence to deliver other stand-alone climate courses or to embed climate in existing courses. The paper proposes that a suitable resource manual should be ‘problem-based’ in its design to allow for a broad range of geographic climates, and should address a wide range of agricultural enterprises including livestock production, horticulture and cropping. The authors also propose ways to introduce and integrate applied climate knowledge and skills into the wider community.

However, these goals were undermined by state polices linking standardized tests with student promotion and graduation, and the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) that required public schools and districts to aggregate test scores which might have negative consequences, such as reducing school funding or privatizing school administration and state policies.

This longitudinal study compared the environmental literacy of 214 students at the onset and towards the end of their studies, in three academic colleges of education in Israel. A questionnaire and a paired pre-test–post-test design were used to explore environmental literacy variables and their perceptions regarding the contribution of their college studies to their environmental literacy and worldviews. Students towards the end of their studies reported increased involvement in most of the study’s environmental behaviour categories as compared to the beginning. Despite this, the pattern characterizing their environmental behaviour did not change: a negative relationship was found between the frequency at which they engaged in different behaviour categories and the environmental-commitment-level of the corresponding category. Overall, while their environmental attitudes were positive, both as beginning and advanced students, their level of environmental knowledge remained low. Advanced students noted the limited contribution of their studies to the development of their environmental literacy and worldviews. In spite of the improvement in students’ environmental literacy over the course of their studies, the levels of their environmental literacy towards the end of studies are still inadequate for educators. The findings from this study are of relevance to decision makers bringing environmental education into the policy of teacher education institutions, and for program developers, on effective directions for integrating environmental education given the structures and frameworks of current programs. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",environmental attitudes; environmental behaviour; environmental education; environmental literacy; pre-service teacher education,,,,,,,,,,"Yavetz, B.; Kibbutzim College of Education, , Tel Aviv, Israel; email: belay@macam.ac.il",,,,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

These can be described as including interpretive critique or ‘speaking truth to power’, public space and collaboration, and the role of research imagination in social life.

While the UK strategy for sustainable development called for a result indicator to show the impact of ESD on learners’ knowledge and awareness of sustainable development, the indicator that was recommended to government by its advisers, after consulting the ESD community, was essentially a facilitative indicator showing the percentage of schools that rated themselves good or outstanding using a self-evaluation instrument linked to the emerging sustainable schools framework. An opportunity to monitor the impact of ESD on learners’ sustainability literacy and encourage more socially critical approaches was lost as the micro-politics of ESD (the preferences of advisers and those consulted) failed to challenge the macro-politics examined in the author’s earlier article. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",citizenship; critical education; indicators; policy; political literacy; sustainability literacy; sustainable development,,,,,,,,,,"Huckle, J., Bedford, United Kingdom; email: john@huckle.org.uk",,,,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

The study was descriptive in nature and involved the collection of qualitative data from 91 seventh grade students from three different schools in the Midwest, USA. An open response and draw and explain assessment instrument was administered to students. These data were analyzed for content in an inductive manner to identify students' concepts. The categories that emerged from the students' responses reflected different degrees of sophistication or conceptualization about global warming and climate change. The students' conceptions of global warming and climate change in this study were similar to previous studies in that they lacked a rich conceptualization of the issue, especially as it pertains to the greenhouse effect and its connection to global warming. At the same time, this study expanded on previous studies by further elucidating students' conceptions of the impact of global warming on the Earth's oceans, weather, and plants and animals. Here too, students lacked a rich conceptualization.

While polling research indicates that most American adults believe climate change is happening, the data also show there is widespread confusion about the causes of the change and the degree of scientific consensus around the human impacts on the climate system. Consumers and corporations, who may lack an understanding of the important role of carbon in the climate system, are encouraged to reduce carbon emissions, purchase carbon offsets, and consider carbon labels that show the amount of embedded greenhouse gases in products and services. Utility companies promoting the use of smart meters find that many consumers do not understand how their electricity is generated or the role played by fossil fuels, which are in effect concentrated forms of buried solar energy linking energy use today to past and future climates. While aggressive media, corporate, and political forces are often regarded as the primary cause of the public's climate confusion, a review of five decades of science education relating to climate in general and climate change in particular reveals that basic climate science has not been well addressed in national and state education standards or science education curricula. Moreover, key misconceptions and misinformation about basic climate science are strongly held by students, teachers, and public audiences. We review research on these misconceptions and call upon educators and communicators to address systemic holes and pedagogical gaps with high-quality resources and professional development. The recently developed Essential Principles of Climate Literacy provides an authoritative, comprehensive framework for educators and communicators to frame climate science. However, to be effectively used as a tool for increasing broad climate literacy, effective mental models to address misconceptions will need to be integral to the high-quality resources and professional development programs required to significantly increase climate literacy throughout society.

At the same time, space-based Earth-observing agencies like NASA and NOAA in the United States have geometrically increased the volume of data they collect everyday over the entire globe. Fortunately, Moore's Law held true during that same time span, so that the processing capacity of modern computers has exponentially increased, enabling scientists to collect, process, and share these data with increasing efficiency and turnaround time. Since 1980, the combination of these technologies has substantially increased public access to cutting-edge climate science data and information. But has there been a corresponding increase in public climate science literacy? Has there also been a corresponding improvement in public attitudes and opinions about climate science research? In this paper, we review current research about public awareness, understanding, and opinions about existing climate research. We also review several initiatives that our agencies (NASA and NOAA) have taken to help improve climate science literacy. Our research coincides with others' findings in, suggesting that it is possible to improve climate science literacy and positive attitudes about modern climate research, via particular methods of communication. We conclude with a call for collaborators to work with NASA and NOAA in the assembly of a ""synergetic"" new climate science communications and education infrastructure, as articulated by the late R. Buckminster Fuller, in which the whole works together much more effectively than the sum of the individual parts. We argue that the inherent difficulty of improving public climate science literacy, much less addressing the problems that stem from illiteracy and negative attitudes toward climate science, render the problem too great for any one agency or effort to tackle alone. Addressing the problem synergistically through transdisciplinary collaborations increases the potential for success while enriching all those involved in climate literacy efforts.

Focusing on their shared interests in the human-environment interactions of land use illuminates the differences and similarities relevant to these themes. Divergence is found primarily in regard to their different foci of interests about causes and consequences of land change. Convergence is revealed in the identification of the complexity of the interactions and the importance of context in land-change outcomes and in the general consensus found in such synthesis issues as forest transitio s, vulnerability, and coproduction of science and application. ©2008 by Annual Reviews.",Coupled human-environment system; Human ecologies; Human-environment relationships,Co-production; Coupled human-environment system; Human ecologies; Human-environment interaction; Human-environment relationships; Human-environment systems; Political ecology; Sustainability science; Land use; Sustainable development; Ecology,,,,,,,,,"Turner, B.

Scientific understanding is but one of the many types of meanings that can accrue to a given place. People develop emotional attachments to meaningful places. The sense of place, encompassing the meanings and attachments that places hold for people, has been well characterized in environmental psychology. Its components, place attachment and place meaning, can be measured psychometrically. Place-based science teaching focuses on local and regional environments and synthesizes different ways of knowing them, leveraging the senses of place of students and teachers. Place-based teaching has been advocated for its relevance and potential to attract underrepresented groups to science. We posit that sense of place is a measurable learning outcome of place-based science teaching. We developed an Arizona-based, culturally inclusive, meaning-rich introductory geology course, and used published surveys to assess place attachment and meaning in students who took the course. We observed significant gains in student place attachment and place meaning, indicating that these instruments are generalizable and sensitive enough for use in this context.

Papers are organized into three categories: sustainability and its definition, domain-oriented research, and a research framework for sustainability science. First, we provide a short history and define the basic characteristics of sustainability; then we review current efforts in the following research domains: climate, biodiversity, agriculture, fishery, forestry, energy and resources, water, economic development, health, and lifestyle. Finally, we propose a research framework for sustainability science that includes the following components: goal setting, indicator setting, indicator measurement, causal chain analysis, forecasting, backcasting, and problem-solution chain analysis. We emphasize the importance of this last component for improving situations and attaining goals. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2008.",Research core; Research framework; Structuring knowledge; Sustainability science,,,,,,,,,,"Kajikawa, Y.; Institute of Engineering Innovation, 2-11-16 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8656, Japan; email: kaji@biz-model.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp",,,,,,,,18624065,,,,English,Sustainability Sci.,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-56149118031

In designing an effective mitigation strategy, it is clear that public education must play an important role. This study looks at various components of climate change literacy within a cohort of university students and investigates the impact of action-oriented learning on student understanding. Results from questionnaires given to primarily nonscience students enrolled in weather and climate courses are used to examine student knowledge of climate change. In agreement with prior research, this study finds that significant student misconceptions exist regarding the causes of global warming and the relationship between global warming and ozone depletion. Most students seem to conhect global warming only with visible poilution, such as exhaust from either a car or factory, while discounting more indirect emissions such as from electricity use and through product or food consumption. The authors then explore how a learning activity designed around the ""ecological footprint"" affects student ideas about their personal energy use and connections with global warming. The results show that a relatively simple learning activity that personally engages the student improves understanding of the connection between personal energy use and global warming. This work suggests that similar curricula, employing methods of personal engagement and social activism, be further developed to aid in the teaching of climate change. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,Air pollution; Canning; Climate control; Climatology; Curricula; Education; Energy management; Environmental protection; Food preservation; Food supply; Global warming; Ozone; Ozone layer; Students; Teaching; Ecological footprint; Electricity use; Food consumption; Learning activities; Mitigation strategies; Ozone depletion; Personal energy; Public education; Social issues; Student knowledge; University students; Climate change,,,,,,,,,"Cordero, E.C.; Department of Meteorology, , San José, CA 95192-0104, United States; email: cordero@met.sjsu.edu",,,,,,,,30007,,BAMIA,,English,Bull.

Short of a complete overhaul of education, the paper seeks to propose learning objectives that can be integrated across existing curricula. These learning objectives are organized by head, hands and heart - balancing cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains. University programs and courses meeting these learning objectives exhibit an emergent property here termed transformative sustainability learning (TSL). Design/methodology/approach - Theoretically, TSL grew from traditions of sustainability education and transformative education. Practically, TSL emerged from experimental learning collaborations sponsored by the University of British Columbia in 2003 and 2004 in an effort to enable explicit transitions to sustainability-oriented higher education. Primarily through action research, these community-based, applied learning experiences constituted cyclical processes of innovation, implementation and reflection. Findings - The paper finds: advancement of head, hands and heart as an organizing principle by which to integrate transdisciplinary study (head); practical skill sharing and development (hands); and translation of passion and values into behaviour (heart); development of a cognitive landscape for understanding TSL as a unifying framework amongst related sustainability and transformative pedagogies that are inter/transdisciplinary, practical and/or place-based; creation of learning objectives, organized to evaluate a course or program's embodiment of TSL. Originality/value - By enabling change within existing structures of higher education, the paper complements and contributes to more radical departures from the institution. The work to date demonstrates potential in applying this learning framework to courses and programs in higher education. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Action research; Canada; Education; Experiential learning; Learning,,,,,,,,,,"Sipos, Y.; Integrated Studies, , Vancouver, Canada; email: yona@interchange.ubc.ca",,,,,,,,14676370,,,,English,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - An analysis based on a literature review of relevant educational endeavours in affective learning. Findings - This paper suggests that most teaching and assessment in higher education focus on cogitative skills of knowledge and understanding rather than on affective outcomes of values, attitudes and behaviours. Some areas of higher education, however, have effectively pursued affective outcomes and these use particular learning and teaching activities to do so. Key issues for consideration include assessing outcomes and evaluating courses, providing academic credit for affective outcomes, key roles for role models and designing realistic and acceptable learning outcomes in the affective domain. Practical implications - Educators for sustainability could use this relevant theoretical underpinning and experience gained in other areas of education to address the impact of their own learner-support activities. Originality/value - Educators have traditionally been reluctant to pursue affective learning outcomes but often programmes of study simply fail to identify and describe their legitimate aims in these terms. This paper emphasises the application of a relevant theoretical underpinning to support educators' legitimate aspirations for affective learning outcomes. It will also help these educators to reflect on how the use of these approaches accords with the liberal traditions of higher education. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Attitudes; Behaviour; Education; Learning; Teaching methods; Value analysis,,,,,,,,,,"Shephard, K.; Higher Education Development Centre, , Dunedin, New Zealand; email: kerry.shephard@stonebow.otago.ac.nz",,,,,,,,14676370,,,,English,Int.

Embedded within this charge is the teaching of skills and motivations to implement skills, where a skill refers to performance of an act acquired through extended practice and training (Ericsson and Oliver 1995). However, it is often difficult to articulate clearly what skills we teach in conservation education and environmental education focusing on behavior change or influence. It can be equally challenging to describe the behaviors we are ultimately seeking, identified in the Tbilisi Declaration as ‘new patterns of behavior’ (UNESCO 1978). At a basic level, it is important to explore the grounding for teaching toward behavior–often referred to as behavior change–that supports the work of the field. This literature review attempts to provide a foundation for behavior-related discussions in environmental and conservation education. A number of the behavior theories, concepts and models discussed in this review have been explored extensively elsewhere; therefore, this review is not exhaustive, but rather is intended to be broadly representative of the literature. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",behavior change; behavior theory; conservation education,,,,,,,,,,"Heimlich, J.E.; The Ohio State University and the Institute for Learning Innovation, Columbus, United States; email: heimlich@ilinet.org",,,,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

Hypothesizing that student understanding of the principles of causality plays a fundamental role in the understanding of complexity, undergraduate science majors have been interviewed to explore their approaches to complex natural phenomena and document changes that occur in reasoning when a modified Aristotelian framework of causality principles is introduced.

One of these vices is energy squandering with all its negative consequences for the planet (e.g. depletion of finite energy sources and the subsequent climate change). This paper describes the results of an energy-thrift information and education project taking place in different levels of education in Crete-Greece, which records 321 students' and their parents' routine energy-related behavior and proves that this behavior changes to a more energy efficient one, after the dissemination of relevant information and the participation into the energy education projects. Namely, response percentages indicating the energy-efficient behavior increased after project participation while the ones indicating an energy-squandering behavior decreased. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was statistically significant in all energy behavior questions related to students and to most questions related to parents. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Sustainability science requires the integration of multiple perspectives to resolve place-based problems. This paper will illustrate some of the challenges and emergent understandings that were observed during three research projects that could be characterised as attempting to practice sustainability science. The first two projects focused on designing and developing an integrated assessment approach to analyse possible programmes of measures for the WFD. The third project is an evaluation of a European project that piloted specific measures that might be implemented under WFD. The findings highlight the institutional changes required to deliver sustainability science. To summarise, both the 'rules-in-use' and the 'play-of-the-game', to use the language of the institutional analysis and development framework, will have to change to provide sufficient incentives to make the transition from traditional science to sustainability science. © 2007 The Author(s).

Through combining formal and informal learning settings within higher education - as part of a new learning culture - a variety of contexts can be given and competence development can be enhanced. Research limitations/implications - While aspects of both formal and informal learning settings could be identified, the interdependencies between them remain elusive.

The authors draw on a TLRP-funded seminar series which examined a variety of forms of user engagement, their purposes and their implications. The series attempted to understand the intertwined features of new education spaces where research and policy can meet; the negotiations with policy communities that occur there; and the implications for these negotiations and for research design in the production of pedagogic knowledge in partnership with practitioners. The lessons revealed included the following: user engagement strengthens the warrants of research with potential users in both practice and policy communities; it needs to be understood and sustained as an aspect of project management; and research mediation is a developing form of expertise.

Knowledge in different forms is an essential input to make reasonable and robust decisions about shaping strategies and adequate measures. Many of the types of knowledge involved, however, show general attributes of uncertainty. In the field of sustainable development, uncertainties from different areas merge and create a dramatic increase in the importance and relevance of this issue. Working towards sustainable development, therefore, is not feasible within a classical planning approach; new concepts for approaching the future are needed. Uncertainties are, on the other hand, an indication of the openness of the future and the possibilities of shaping it. Uncertainties in some sense disturb the options for working towards sustainable development, but also allow for learning over time, for adapting and modifying measures due to the results of monitoring processes, etc. Exploiting the chances offered by this situation requires specific implementation strategies in favour of sustainable development, in particular strategies that are open to adaptation and 'online' modification by monitoring the effects of the initial measures.

I analyse three ESD curriculum policy texts to reveal their concealments, silences and blocks to enquiry, demonstrating how their rhetorical forms make them readily assimilable into dominant economic discourse. I then introduce a recent UK Government Report explaining the failure in implementing ESD policies in the school curriculum and I expose how this analysis is a further demonstration of the problems in the prevailing policy perspective.

The article is divided into three parts. First, it reviews the recent discourse of achievement and accountability in general education, as exemplified by the No Child Left Behind Act. Second, it describes the impact of achievement and accountability discourse on environmental education by outlining two responses from environmental educators to the general climate of schooling: 1) accommodation or ‘playing the achievement game’; and 2) resistance or ‘changing the rules’. Third, it explores how related tensions between nationalistic federal education policies and the sweeping global challenges suggested by the United Nation’s Decade of Education for Sustainable Development present additional dilemmas for promoting and implementing environmental education.

It shows that since its inception as a pedagogical field in the 1970s, environmental education has faced many challenges and resistances in the educational systems of Latin America. An analysis of the competing and contradictory discourses of environmental education in developed and developing countries suggests that among other things, system inadequacies and malfunctions, social inequalities, the agendas of modernity and globalisation, and the hybridisation of the field (e.g. with Education for Sustainable Development, adult education, emancipatory educational and political traditions) continue to fissure the discursive identity and configurations of the field in Latin America. The article explores how this affects curricular reform and teacher professional preparation and development, in the context of a depleted conventional school curriculum and its growing inability to respond to the complex challenges of the present. Such a situation can be contrasted with deliberations on the potential articulations of environmental education with the everyday life of the community, a source of opportunity and more positive note on which the article ends. The difference between being and having … is between a society centered around persons and one centered around things.

The study involved 5th grade students from five elementary schools of varying demographic makeup in a large urban school district. The intervention's effectiveness was measured by student responses on a writing prompt addressing this topic in the beginning and at the completion of instruction over the school year.

Using just one single assessment method is not sufficient to determine competence acquisition. This article argues for Competence Assessment Programmes (CAPs), consisting of a combination of different assessment methods, including both traditional and new forms of assessment. To develop and evaluate CAPs, criteria to determine their quality are needed. Just as CAPs are combinations of traditional and new forms of assessment, criteria used to evaluate CAP quality should be derived from both psychometrics and edumetrics. A framework of 10 quality criteria for CAPs is presented, which is then compared to Messick's framework of construct validity. Results show that the 10-criterion framework partly overlaps with Messick's, but adds some important new criteria, which get a more prominent place in quality control issues in competence-based education. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors draw from two broad bodies of work: the public finance literature about demand and the psychology literature about attitudes. The authors propose a conceptual model of the relationships between citizens' direct and mediated exposure to public services, their attitudes about these services, and their willingness to pay for them. The authors present data from a survey of Connecticut adults and use these data to estimate statistical models of the relationship between media exposure and attitudes with regression analysis.

The role of research-based knowledge in this complex setting is ambiguous and diverse, and it is undergoing rapid change both in theory and in practice. We review conventional views of the linkages between research-based knowledge and action, and the early response to concerns that these links could and should be improved, through efforts at translation and transfer. We then examine the range of critiques that challenge those conventional views by highlighting different aspects of the relationships between science and society, focusing on the implications for action toward sustainable development. We then review the theories and strategies that have emerged in the attempt to improve the linkages between research-based knowledge and action in the context of sustainability across four broad categories: participation, integration, learning, and negotiation. These form a hierarchy with respect to how deeply they engage with the various critiques. We propose that the relationships between research-based knowledge and action can be better understood as arenas of shared responsibility, embedded within larger systems of power and knowledge that evolve and change over time. The unique contribution of research-based knowledge needs to be understood in relation to actual or potential contributions from other forms of knowledge. We conclude with questions that may offer useful orientation to assessing or designing research-action arenas for sustainable development. Copyright © 2006 by Annual Reviews.

Furthermore, the knowledge of people involved and their needs and interests at stake have to be taken into account. There are three basic and interrelated questions about issues to be addressed in sustainability research: (1) In which way do processes constitute a problem field and where are the needs for change? (2) What are more sustainable practices? (3) How can existing practices be transformed? To treat them properly, transdisciplinary research is needed.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper reveals the historical roots of case studies, transdisciplinarity and sustainable development as teaching and research paradigms. The TCS approach is presented, which has been developed at ETH for supporting transition management of regional, urban, and organizational systems. This approach is entrenched by an ontology that reveals the basic characteristics of ill-defined transition problems, an epistemology that refers to Probabilistic Functionalism and distinguishes between multi-layered systemic and normative epistemics, a methodology that includes a set of methods for case representation (including modelling and projection), assessment, and strategy building, and a project management model that refers to more than a dozen TCSs in the field of sustainable development. Problems of validity of TCSs as a research methodology are discussed. Findings – Three major strengths of the TCS approach presented in the paper are: that it is based on three sound paradigms, which focus on different, relevant characteristics of complex, human-environment systems; i.e. the case study approach, transdisciplinarity and sustainable development, that it is strictly organized according to an elaborated and consistent theoretical framework that includes ontological, epistemological, methodological, and organizational considerations, and that it is itself subject to an ongoing inquiry and adaptation process. All theoretical considerations of the paper are clarified be elaborated examples from the more than 10 years experience with TCS of the authors. Practical implications – The paper gives a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation of TCS that might assist other scientists engaged in case study research and teaching to further develop their approaches. Additionally, relevant topics for further research in the field of TCS are presented which hopefully induce an inspiring discussion among case study researchers. Originality/value – As far we know, this paper is one of the first that presents a comprehensive and theoretically sound overview of applying transdisciplinary case studies as means of sustainability learning.

As a logical consequence, educating for sustainable development also has a complex character. Traditional unidirectional educational processes are only of very limited use when educating for sustainable development: Firstly, the initial state of the considered system (case) cannot be described precisely; secondly, the target state of the system is also not sufficiently known; and thirdly, the process between initial state and target state and potential barriers that might have to be passed are also not exactly known. Pure analytically based solutions are therefore, not available; a dynamic mutual learning process is required instead. Mutual learning based on real-world cases requires an interdisciplinary point of view, transdisciplinary problem-solving processes, and self-regulated and self-responsible learning. Consequently, besides analytical capabilities and deterministic process planning, dealing with the complex problem of sustainable development requires creativity, social competencies and specific communication skills in order to cope with the dynamic change that characterizes the developments in most facets of society and nature. A ""vassal"" that puts together all these requirements towards an educational process for sustainable development can be a transdisciplinary case study approach: In Austria this was first applied by the University of Graz within the ""Erzherzog Johann case study"". In order to educate for sustainable development, the students had to work on a ""real-world problem"", the development of possible ways to achieve ecologically, economically and socially sustainable development of the abandoned iron ore mining region of Eisenerz in the middle of Austria. As a core characteristic of this ""real-world"" case study, besides the cooperation among students, teachers and researchers of the university, the interaction with stakeholders of the region was of outstanding importance. Within transdisciplinary case studies students, teachers and researchers have to abandon the role paradigm of the teacher as provider of information and the students as ""consumers"" of the provided information. Knowledge and competences imparted in university classes need to be applied simultaneously within the real-world case to allow a demand-driven process of mutual learning in which students are self-responsible and decide which tools to apply in the process of attaining sustainable development. Because of the dynamics of this process, students experience the process of sustainable development instead of purely memorizing its characteristics. The process of educating for sustainable development and practical applied sustainability therefore, becomes sustainable. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It seeks answers to the question: in which ways and intensity can educational work in schools match different stages of general societal discussions on environmental problems? It is often said that school and school teaching suffer from a general ‘cultural lag’—that is, that they lag behind current social problems. It is argued in this article that there is a remarkable parallelism between public discussion of environmental issues and their consideration in school teaching. This analysis goes back to the roots of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Contrary to some current positions, it is argued here that ESD not only has roots in nature protection education and environmental education, but also that it goes beyond those roots.

The paper reviews some schemas and views in the Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) debate regarding what constitutes 'capability' in this area, and finds an emerging pattern of broad consensus. Whilst some see sustainability as implying a major challenge for the purposes and nature of university education as a whole, it is still necessary to indicate curriculum ideas that any HEI can begin to implement, ideally as a precursor to deeper change. Between the undesirable extremes of curriculum prescription and emergence, the authors suggest some indicative schemas that might help academics design curricula for ESD. Further, a model of staged learning and change linking institutional change with deepening student experience is suggested, based on current work at RMIT and the University of Plymouth.

Assigned reading served as the basis for individual questions, while lectures and discussions helped to define group research questions and associated projects whose results were presented in class. Our analysis of students' questions shows improvement in students' ability to formulate questions in terms of the variable's applicability to the model. Mid-range and low-scoring students showed abrupt and gradual improvement, respectively, while higher-scoring students tended to immediately and consistently perform well.

Learners come to the classroom with prior knowledge on the topic, which serves as a foundation for further knowledge building, but can also pose barriers to conceptual change. Learners have existing mental models that may limit their perception and processing of conflicting information and prevent adoption of scientific conceptions. Instructional strategies that attempt conceptual change by simply provoking cognitive conflict have had limited success due to the importance of epistemological beliefs and motivation to the conceptual change process. The Mock Environment Summit course uses role-playing, argumentation and discussion to heighten epistemological awareness and motivation and thereby facilitate conceptual change. The pre/post-course concept map evaluation of students' knowledge about the science of global climate change reported here shows evidence of significant learning and conceptual change. Our study also provides useful information about gaps in knowledge and the types of misconceptions students are likely to have about this topic.

It much rather consists of a problem-oriented combination of explanatory, orientation-, and action-guiding knowledge. For the generation and application of this strategic knowledge, new trails, which are only rudimentarily discernible, have to be trod.

The context of the research is one of growing concern at the potential impacts of global warming, yet demonstrably low levels of self-efficacy amongst both adults and children to effectively respond to this large-scale environmental problem. Empirical research was conducted on a sample of 198 UK children and adults to explore the influence of a cooperative learning environment upon children's beliefs about global warming and energy. A comparative design was adopted, contrasting 9–12 year old members of the Woodcraft Folk educational organisation with non-members of similar age and with adult members of the same organisation. Results indicate that cooperative learning environments can have a significant and positive effect upon children's beliefs about large-scale environmental problems. In particular, Woodcraft folk children reported significantly higher levels of personal awareness and perceived self-efficacy in relation to global warming in comparison to their peers. Secondly, unexpected differences were identified between levels of perceived self-efficacy in children and adult Woodcraft folk. The implications of these differences for the design of educational programmes seeking to empower children to respond to global warming are discussed. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Devine-Wright, P.; Institute of Energy and Sustainable Development, De Montfort University Queens' Building, Leicester, The Gateway, LE1 9EH, United Kingdom; email: pdwright@dmu.ac.uk",,,,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

Answers to an open-ended test were interpreted using a systems thinking continuum, ranging from a completely static view of the system to an understanding of the system's cyclic nature. A meaningful improvement in students' views of the rock cycle toward the higher side of the systems thinking continuum was found after the knowledge integration activity. Students more aware of the dynamic and cyclic nature of the rock cycle, and their ability to construct sequences of processes representing material transformation in relatively large chunks significantly improved. Success of the knowledge integration activity stresses the importance of postknowledge acquisition activities, which engage students in a dual process of differentiation of their knowledge and reintegration in a systems context.

Because of the range and interconnectedness of environmental, social and economic issues, and the importance of interdisciplinary thinking and holistic insight, deep learning is particularly relevant in the context of education for sustainability. However, deep learning can be inhibited if the existing interests or backgrounds of students have a strong disciplinary focus.

To address such issues the seminar, 'Environmental Education: from policy to practice', was held at King's College London in March 2001, under the sponsorship of the British Council and directed by Justin Dillon. The seminar brought together environmental educators from a broad spectrum--policy developers, researchers and practitioners--from Belize, Botswana, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Swaziland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. During a thought-provoking six days the seminar discussed a diverse range of ideas about the current trends and future practices in environmental education.

System dynamics is designed to help avoid such policy resistance and identify high-leverage policies for sustained improvement. What does it take to be an effective systems thinker, and to teach system dynamics fruitfully? Understanding complex systems requires mastery of concepts such as feedback, stocks and flows, time delays, and nonlinearity. Research shows that these concepts are highly counterintuitive and poorly understood. It also shows how they can be taught and learned. Doing so requires the use of formal models and simulations to test our mental models and develop our intuition about complex systems. Yet, though essential, these concepts and tools are not sufficient. Becoming an effective systems thinker also requires the rigorous and disciplined use of scientific inquiry skills so that we can uncover our hidden assumptions and biases. It requires respect and empathy for others and other viewpoints. Most important, and most difficult to learn, systems thinking requires understanding that all models are wrong and humility about the limitations of our knowledge. Such humility is essential in creating an environment in which we can learn about the complex systems in which we are embedded and work effectively to create the world we truly desire.

But many advocate delaying action until there is more evidence that warming is harmful. The stock and flow structure of the climate, however, means ""wait and see"" policies guarantee further warming. Atmospheric CO 2 concentration is now higher than any time in the last 420,000 years, and growing faster than any time in the past 20,000 years. The high concentration of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) generates significant radiative forcing that contributes to warming. To reduce radiative forcing and the human contribution to warming, GHG concentrations must fall. To reduce GHG concentrations, emissions must fall below the rate at which GHGs are removed from the atmosphere. Anthropogenic CO 2 emissions are now roughly double the removal rate, and the removal rate is projected to fall as natural carbon sinks saturate. Emissions must therefore fall by more than half even to stabilize CO 2 at present record levels. Such reductions greatly exceed the Kyoto targets, while the Bush administration's Clear Skies Initiative calls for continued emissions growth. Does the public understand these physical facts? We report experiments assessing people's intuitive understanding of climate change. We presented highly educated graduate students with descriptions of greenhouse warming drawn from the IPCC's nontechnical reports. Subjects were then asked to identify the likely response to various scenarios for CO 2 emissions or concentrations. The tasks require no mathematics, only an understanding of stocks and flows and basic facts about climate change. Overall performance was poor. Subjects often select trajectories that violate conservation of matter. Many believe temperature responds immediately to changes in CO 2 emissions or concentrations. Still more believe that stabilizing emissions near current rates would stabilize the climate, when in fact emissions would continue to exceed removal, increasing GHG concentrations and radiative forcing. Such beliefs support ""wait and see"" policies, but violate basic laws of physics. We discuss implications for education and public policy.

To use the Model United Nations format effectively requires the instructor to plan carefully, coordinate activities with the other elements of a class, and never allow the ""game"" to overwhelm the learning. When done correctly, the excitement generated by the Model United Nations can be a key for opening the world to students who might otherwise have drifted through the mandatory introduction to international relations.

It describes the emergence and development of an ecologically‐driven agenda for school change, and its rationale, within a shifting policy‐context in which the environmental concerns of the public are being increasingly acknowledged. The programme can be interpreted as a policy response to public concerns. However, ENSI's agenda, the author argues, radically differs from a school improvement agenda based on economistic assumptions. The idea of ‘sustainable development’ as an education policy goal is examined in the light of these two agendas and found to carry ambiguous meanings. ENSI's agenda is concerned with transforming existing structures and processes of schooling to enable students to play an active role in shaping an ecologically sustainable social and economic order. The school improvement agenda is dominated by concerns about the economic performativity of individuals in society. It only appears to imply a ‘fine‐tuning’ of the traditional structures and processes of schooling rather than any radical transformation. The paper identifies conflicting trends within contemporary education policy contexts that carry very different conceptions of envimomental education for ‘sustainable development’. The author argues that in this situation there is a danger that the ENSI network will lose sight of its radical agenda and fail to sustain its previous momentum. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Elliott, J.; Centre for Applied Research in Education, , Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,0305764X,,,,English,Camb.

The study was based at the Institute of Education, University of Stirling, and was sponsored (between November 1997 and March 1998) by the Sustainable Schools Partnership, with funding from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Worldwide Fund for Nature Scotland and (between April 1998 and July 1998) by the University of Stirling. It comprised three research strands: a trawl of documentary evidence relating to policy and practice within the field of education for sustainability; interviews with key personnel in secondary schools identified as developing good practice in the field of education for sustainability; and a series of discussions with policy makers having a national and/or international perspective on education for sustainability and its development in schools. Although the prime focus was on Scottish schools, each of these strands also covered as a secondary concern relevant work in the other national regions of the UK. Having briefly clarified some issues of definition, the article offers an analysis of the central problem faced by schools (secondary schools in particular) involved in cross-curriculum developments of this kind. That analysis focuses upon the aspiration of these schools to bring about whole-school change within an institutional context characterised by strong boundary maintenance. The article then outlines the first of two findings: where education for sustainability is being developed within a secondary school setting, whole-school change is likely to be conceived as modest modifications to existing structures. The article goes on, however, to outline some of the changing practices within these schools and, in doing so, introduces the second finding: where education for sustainability is being developed within a secondary school setting, whole-school change is likely to be conceived in terms of a reorientation of professional interest and practice towards the local community and wider community concerns. These two findings, we argue, should be seen neither as complementary nor as existing in creative tension. They point to a school system seriously at odds with itself: pulled by one set of professional and managerial priorities towards piecemeal change within fixed parameters and by a very different set of professional and educational responses towards the reconceptualisa-tion of teaching and learning and the closer involvement of schools in the local communities. This increased interest in the outward-looking school community extends to issues of global concern. The article concludes with some thoughts on how this tension might be resolved through a radical reordering of educational priorities in favour of boundary realignment and community participation. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Nixon, J.; Institute of Education University of Stirling, Stirling, FK9 4LA, United Kingdom; email: j.d.nixon@stir.ac.uk",,,,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

Analysis of the data led to the formation of seven distinct models of thinking regarding this environmental phenomenon. The inferred models are differentiated according to the following criteria: (a) the position and distribution of the greenhouse gases; (b) the existence of connections between the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer, or its depletion; and (c) the types of radiation considered to be involved in the greenhouse effect. However, children's models involve a common core of beliefs, according to which the greenhouse effect is due to solar radiation that heats up the earth and the atmosphere, while getting trapped by certain atmospheric gases, and severely changes the climate, melts the polar ice, and raises the sea level. Furthermore, the alternative conceptions involved in students' models are systematically examined to establish their teaching implications. The main teaching implications discussed here concern: (a) the concept of uniform diffusion of atmospheric gases; (b) the conceptual distinction between ultraviolet and other forms of solar radiation; (c) the conceptual distinction between sunlight and terrestrial radiation; and (d) the conceptual distinction between the roles of the ozone layer and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

The aim of this study was to investigate fifth graders' changes of conceptions about the greenhouse effect and global warming, due to socio-cognitive interaction developed in small and large group discussions in an authentic classroom context during the implementation of an environmental education curriculum unit. We hypothesized that a classroom transformed into a community of discoursei.e. a learning environment which stimidates and supports giving verbal explanations, comparing and critically evaluating different points of view on the examined environmental phenomenon, would be a fruitful breeding ground for knowledge revision. The results show that classroom discussions, the core of the proposed learning activity, led the children, although at different levels, to the integration of new scientific knowledge into their conceptual ecology, based on the personal revision of pre-instructional conceptions. As hypothesized, a high positive correlation was found between conceptual change and metaconceptual awareness of the changes in pre-existing representations of the examined phenomenon.

It looks at recent curricular developments in EE and the degree to which they are supported by present practices in teacher education. In the face of considerable air and water pollution problems, the territory has shifted from a largely technocentric, engineering/environmental health approach to solving environmental problems to one which stresses community education as an additional linchpin. Central educational authorities have encouraged a largely cross-curricular programme of EE. However, despite the rhetoric of official guidelines, developments in the schools are fragmentary, with a focus on knowledge acquisition. The situation in teacher education institutions to a large degree parallels that in the schools. The efficacy of teacher education in facilitating change is insufficient and is mainly attributable to the style of teacher education programmes in the territory. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Stimpson, P.G.; Department of Curriculum Studies, , Pokfulam, Hong Kong",,,,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

The majority of students introduced ‘ozone layer’ or ‘ultraviolet radiation’ in response to the question, ‘When you think about global warming, what comes to mind?’ Approximately one-half of the students held the alternative conceptions that ozone layer depletion is a major cause of global warming and that carbon dioxide destroys the ozone layer. These and other alternative conceptions evidenced by the students suggest that global warming instruction should help students clarify that ozone layer depletion and global warming are different environmental problems and that the ozone ‘hole’ does not enhance the greenhouse effect. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

It explains why macroeconomic policy is the key to the transition, and how an agenda for fundamental regulatory and fiscal reform has to be combined with a new framework for decision-making. -Publisher",,complex adaptive system; conceptual studies; fiscal reform; macroeconomic policy; policy implication; sustainable development; systems approach,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earthscan, London, with Institute for Policy Analysis & Development",,,,,,1853833142; 1853833193; 9781853833144; 9781853833199,,,English,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041148053

It describes the results of a small scale survey designed to ascertain details of student knowledge and misconceptions about these environmental issues. The study reveals familiarity with the term ‘greenhouse effect’, but little understanding of the concepts involved. One common misconception is that the greenhouse effect is the result of ozone layer depletion. In contrast, there is a clear understanding that the ozone layer protects the Earth from harmful radiation and that it is currently being destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Burning coal is linked to the formation of acid rain, but there is little appreciation of why trees in Scandinavia are being destroyed by this process. Recommendations for lecturers and student teachers are made from the findings. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Dove, J.; School of Education, Heavitree Road, Exeter, EX1 2LU, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,13504622,,,,English,Environ.

Children's models involve a variety of alternative conceptions which indicate the presence of a number of different target obstacles; that is, critical factors constraining children's understanding and thus preventing the construction of adequate models. Five target obstacles were identified: (1) the lack of conceptual distinction between ultraviolet and other forms of solar radiation; (2) the lack of the absorption mechanism of ultraviolet rays by ozone; (3) the conceptualisation of the atmosphere as an entirely homogeneous mixture of its constituent gases; (4) the non-localisation of the ozone layer around the earth; and (5) the lack of interpretation of the ozone hole as a decrease in the concentration of ozone.

I examine four possible responses to the dominant Western/Northern interpretation of environmental education and argue that in South Africa the fourth response may prove to be the most fruitful one to pursue, for it moves beyond tensions generated by race and class issues. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The economic perspective raises questions such as: what kind of development is to be sustained? Is it economic growth? Quality of life? Ecosystem integrity? The ethical perspective considers questions such as: what should be the criteria for ‘progress’? What is our moral obligation to future generations? The paper argues that education for sustainability programmes ought to acknowledge and address these questions. If they do not, then, given the complexity and volatility of late 20th century global society, the current stress on education playing a major role in achieving sustainability (IUCN, UNEP & WWF, 1991) may be unduly naïve and under-theorised. Finally, I contend that the goals of environmental education need to be reconceptualised, continually and reflexively, in response to the globalisation of industrial risks. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Some of these, notably the idea of sustainability, need further development and careful use.

However, in the Sixth Curriculum for schools in Korea, which will take effect from 1995, ‘Environment’ subject is included as an optional course for junior high school students. This paper gives details of the curriculum of ‘Environment’ subject and describes the development of the course textbook which focuses on values and attitude change. The paper also discusses Ministry of Education plans for teacher education and training courses for teachers of the new subject. Despite the current lack of qualified teachers for the subject and the fact that it is not mandatory, the introduction of the ‘Environment’ subject in the national curriculum is seen to be of great significance. With rapidly increasing national concern about environmental issues, and with an increasing number of schools teaching ‘Environment’ subject, it is expected that environmental education in Korea will move more efficiently and profoundly towards realizing its ultimate purpose. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In the 1990s, mounting concern over environment and development problems has meant greater support for an educational approach, which not only considers immediate environmental improvement as an actual goal, but also addresses educating for ‘sustainability’ in the long term. Although some education literature has embraced this new focus of environmental education for sustainability (EEFS), it has failed to outline the essence of this approach and has neglected questions about how it differs from the environmental education of the 1980s. No document exists to date which translates the goals of EEFS into guiding principles for its development in schools. Essentially, EEFS needs further definition. This paper is an attempt to engage the debate about what constitutes this new focus of environmental education and how it may differ from conventional approaches to environmental education. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Education about such issues is therefore becoming increasingly important. Although educational strategies and resources are best designed based on an appreciation of children's preconceptions, little is known about children's ideas in this area. We have undertaken a questionnaire and interview study of the ideas of secondary school children aged 11 to 16 about the causes, consequences and possible cures of global warming. The results show that some scientifically more acceptable ideas, such as the notion that an increase in the ‘greenhouse effect’ will cause changes in weather patterns, are already present in younger pupils. Other ideas, generally held by the science community, take time to become established over the period of secondary schooling; an appreciation of the mechanism of global warming by the retention of solar energy is an example. Some misconceptions, for example the idea that an increase in global warming will increase the rate of cardiac disease, show a low incidence in pupils of all ages, whilst others, such as the idea of a link between the global nuclear arsenal and global warming, decrease in older pupils. Alarmingly, some misconceptions remain at high levels even in the oldest pupils. The idea that the use of lead‐free petrol will reduce global warming is an example. The results also reveal underlying themes in children's thinking. Confusion between ozone layer depletion and global warming is one such theme. We suggest that a general problem is that children are aware of a range of environmentally ‘friendly’ and ‘unfriendly’ actions, and cognizant of a range of environmental problems, but that they do not link particular causes with particular consequences. Rather, children appear to think in a general way that all environmentally ‘friendly’ actions help all problems. We suggest that an understanding of major environmental problems is important because their solutions will require far‐reaching changes in society, and that such education should begin early, before misconceptions become embedded in alternative conceptual frameworks and attitudes based on these frameworks become entrenched. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9500693,,,,English,Int.
